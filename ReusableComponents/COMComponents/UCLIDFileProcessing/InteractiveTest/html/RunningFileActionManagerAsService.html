<p>
The following tests requires two or more machines. See associated instructions for preparing machines 
for use with <b>SQL Server 2005</b> or <b>SQL Server 2008</b>.  The machines that run the service are 
called the <b>service machine</b>.  The machine that contains the database is referred to as the 
<b>database machine</b>.
<p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Rules, Images, and FPS files</b>
	<ul>
		<li><b>FLEX Index</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Make a local copy of <b>CT - Manchester - Cott</b> TIF images from 
			Set002.
			<li>Make a local copy of the most recent <b>CT - Manchester - Cott</b> 
			Indexing rules delivery.
<p>
			<li>Create a <b>Queuing</b> FPS file to supply the images for processing.  
			Use a UNC path for the Folder file supplier.
			<li>Create a <b>Listening</b> FPS file to supply existing images for processing.  
			Also define a second supplier to listen to a folder. Use UNC paths for 
			the Folder file suppliers.
