<ul>
	<li><h2>[LegacyRC #3473] - Thread exits with exception</h2>
	<ul>
		<LI><b>Test #1</b> - Invalid task id
		<ul>
			<li>Create a <b>Queuing</b> FPS file to listen to a specific folder.
			<li>Create a <b>Processing</b> FPS file to OCR images and execute rules 
			for the supplied images.
			<li>Set the size of the <b>History</b> to 10 files.
			<li>Supply and Process <b>2</b> files.
			<li>Supply and Process <b>6</b> more files.
			<li>Supply and Process the original <b>2</b> files again.
			<li>Supply and Process <b>15</b> new files.
			<li>Errors are expected as the second processing instances of the original 2 files 
			are removed from the history queue.  This should happen as the 9th and 10th of 
			the new files are going through processing.
<p>
			<li>Exercise the scenario on a stock <b>7.0.0.39</b> installation.
			<li>Confirm that <b>ELI24633</b> exceptions were seen with Debug information 
			as <b>LastCodePos = MLI02389.520</b>.
			<li>Exercise the scenario on a <b>7.0.0.39 + Hotfix #3</b> installation.
			<li>Confirm that processing finishes without error.  An Application Trace 
			exception should be logged for <b>ELI25353 - Task id not found in map.</b>
       		</ul>
   		</LI>
<p>
		<LI><b>Test #2</b> - File removed from history list while being processed
		<ul>
			<li>Create a <b>Queuing</b> FPS file to listen to a specific folder.
			<li>Create a <b>Processing</b> FPS file to OCR images and execute rules 
			for the supplied images.
			<li>Set the size of the <b>History</b> to 10 files.
			<li>Supply and Process <b>9</b> small files plus <b>1</b> relatively large file.
			<li>Supply and Process <b>9</b> new files.  This causes the slow file to be 
			the next file to be removed from the <b>History</b> collection.
			<li>Resupply and reprocess the same large file <b>1</b> more time.
			<li>While the large file is processing, supply <b>4</b> more files from the 
			original set.
			<li>As the first of these original files finishes processing, the history 
			record for the large file will be removed.  Errors will be logged (frequently) 
			each time status updates are attempted.
<p>
			<li>Exercise the scenario on a stock <b>7.0.0.39</b> installation.
			<li>Confirm that lots of <b>Invalid task id</b> exceptions were seen.
			<li>Exercise the scenario on a <b>7.0.0.39 + Hotfix #3</b> installation.
			<li>Confirm that processing finishes without error.  An Application Trace 
			exception should be logged for <b>ELI25355 - Task cannot be removed.</b>
       		</ul>
   		</LI>
<p>
		<LI><b>Test #3</b> - File removed from history list while in Pending state
		<ul>
			<li>Create a <b>Queuing</b> FPS file to listen to a specific folder.
			<li>Create a <b>Processing</b> FPS file to OCR images and execute rules 
			for the supplied images.
			<li>Set the size of the <b>History</b> to 10 files.
			<li>Supply and Process <b>4</b> files.
			<li>Supply and Process <b>5</b> different files.
			<li>Resupply and reprocess the same <b>5</b> files.  This will finish filling 
			the history collection and remove the first four files from the history.
			<li>Supply and Process <b>4</b> relatively large files where OCR and rule 
			execution take about one minute.
			<li>While the slow files are processing, resupply and reprocess the previous 
			<b>9</b> files.  This is expected to cause the first four files to begin 
			processing first since those have smaller file IDs.  
			<li>As the first four files finish processing, they will push history entries 
			off for the next five files.  Since these files are in <b>Pending</b> state, 
			each thread will try and fail to transition the file to <b>Processing</b>.
			<li>Note that this scenario is difficult to set up due to files being provided 
			for processing in an uncertain order.
<p>
			<li>Exercise the scenario on a stock <b>7.0.0.39</b> installation.
			<li>Confirm that each thread fails and stops processing.
			<li>Exercise the scenario on a <b>7.0.0.39 + Hotfix #3</b> installation.
			<li>Confirm that processing finishes without error.
