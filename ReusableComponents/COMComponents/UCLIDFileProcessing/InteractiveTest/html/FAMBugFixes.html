<ul>
    <LI><b>[FlexIDSCore #3073]</b> Running rule set causes FAM to crash
    <!-- fixed v 6.0.0.77c -->
    <ul>
        <li>Prepare a test database
        <li>Modify the associated Crash.fps
        <li>Queue the associated MTG image
        <li>Exercise the associated RSD file
        <li>Confirm that the FAM <b>does not</b> crash.
    </ul>
<p>
    <li><h2>[LegacyRC #3473] - Thread exits with exception</h2>
    <ul>
        <LI><b>Test #1</b> - Invalid task id
        <ul>
            <li>Create a <b>Queuing</b> FPS file to listen to a specific folder.
            <li>Create a <b>Processing</b> FPS file to OCR images and execute rules for the
            supplied images.
            <li>Set the size of the <b>History</b> to 10 files.
            <li>Supply and Process <b>2</b> files.
            <li>Supply and Process <b>6</b> more files.
            <li>Supply and Process the original <b>2</b> files again.
            <li>Supply and Process <b>15</b> new files.
            <li>Errors are expected as the second processing instances of the original 2 files are
            removed from the history queue.  This should happen as the 9th and 10th of the new
            files are going through processing.
<p>
            <li>Exercise the scenario on a stock <b>7.0.0.39</b> installation.
            <li>Confirm that <b>ELI24633</b> exceptions were seen with Debug information as 
            <b>LastCodePos = MLI02389.520</b>.
            <li>Exercise the scenario on a <b>7.0.0.39 + Hotfix #3</b> installation.
            <li>Confirm that processing finishes without error.  An Application Trace exception
            should be logged for <b>ELI25353 - Task id not found in map.</b>
        </ul>
<p>
        <LI><b>Test #2</b> - File removed from history list while being processed
        <ul>
            <li>Create a <b>Queuing</b> FPS file to listen to a specific folder.
            <li>Create a <b>Processing</b> FPS file to OCR images and execute rules for the
            supplied images.
            <li>Set the size of the <b>History</b> to 10 files.
            <li>Supply and Process <b>9</b> small files plus <b>1</b> relatively large file.
            <li>Supply and Process <b>9</b> new files.  This causes the slow file to be the next
            file to be removed from the <b>History</b> collection.
            <li>Resupply and reprocess the same large file <b>1</b> more time.
            <li>While the large file is processing, supply <b>4</b> more files from the original
            set.
            <li>As the first of these original files finishes processing, the history record for
            the large file will be removed.  Errors will be logged (frequently) each time status
            updates are attempted.
<p>
            <li>Exercise the scenario on a stock <b>7.0.0.39</b> installation.
            <li>Confirm that lots of <b>Invalid task id</b> exceptions were seen.
            <li>Exercise the scenario on a <b>7.0.0.39 + Hotfix #3</b> installation.
            <li>Confirm that processing finishes without error.  An Application Trace exception
            should be logged for <b>ELI25355 - Task cannot be removed.</b>
        </ul>
<p>
        <LI><b>Test #3</b> - File removed from history list while in Pending state
        <ul>
            <li>Create a <b>Queuing</b> FPS file to listen to a specific folder.
            <li>Create a <b>Processing</b> FPS file to OCR images and execute rules for the
            supplied images.
            <li>Set the size of the <b>History</b> to 10 files.
            <li>Supply and Process <b>4</b> files.
            <li>Supply and Process <b>5</b> different files.
            <li>Resupply and reprocess the same <b>5</b> files.  This will finish filling the
            history collection and remove the first four files from the history.
            <li>Supply and Process <b>4</b> relatively large files where OCR and rule execution
            take about one minute.
            <li>While the slow files are processing, resupply and reprocess the previous <b>9</b>
            files.  This is expected to cause the first four files to begin processing first since
            those have smaller file IDs.  
            <li>As the first four files finish processing, they will push history entries off for 
            the next five files.  Since these files are in <b>Pending</b> state, each thread will
            try and fail to transition the file to <b>Processing</b>.
            <li>Note that this scenario is difficult to set up due to files being provided for
            processing in an uncertain order.
<p>
            <li>Exercise the scenario on a stock <b>7.0.0.39</b> installation.
            <li>Confirm that each thread fails and stops processing.
            <li>Exercise the scenario on a <b>7.0.0.39 + Hotfix #3</b> installation.
            <li>Confirm that processing finishes without error. 
        </ul>
    </ul>
