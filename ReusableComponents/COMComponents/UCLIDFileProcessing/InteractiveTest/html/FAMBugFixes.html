<ul>
    	<li><b>[LegacyRC #5610]</b> FAM processing threads must grab file before stopping
    	<ul>
        	<li>Create a database and enqueue a small (~20) number of files.</li>
        	<li>Configure an .fps file with a verification task. Set it up to use a large 
		number of threads to processing (at least twice as many threads as there 
		are files to process).</li>
        	<li>Start processing, then immediately stop.</li>
        	<li>Confirm that processing stops immediately and that the initially idle 
		threads do not have to grab files first.</li>
    	</ul></li>
<p>    
    	<li><b>[LegacyRC #5835]</b> FAM pause button
    	<!-- fixed v 8.1.0.18 -->
    	<ul>
        	<li>Set up an .fps file with at least one processing task and a number of 
		files already queued.</li>
        	<li>Press the play button and then (as quickly as possible) hit the pause 
		button.</li>
        	<li>Confirm that processing is correctly paused.</li>
    	</ul></li>
<p>
    	<li><b>[LegacyRC #5922]</b> Processing with multiple FAMs
    	<ul>
        	<li>Queue several copies of the ID Shield demo images.</li>
        	<li>Modify <b>Compute Redactions.fps</b> to include a 20 second sleep and 
		no queueing.</li>
        	<li>Open and run 5 instances of Compute Redactions.fps.</li>
        	<li>Confirm that no deadlock exceptions are seen.</li>
    	</ul></li>
<p>
    	<li><b>[LegacyRC #5923]</b> Processing and queueing with multiple FAMs
    	<ul>
        	<li>Create several copies of the ID Shield demo images.</li>
        	<li>Add a 20 second sleep to <b>Compute Redactions.fps</b>.</li>
        	<li>Open <b>5</b> instances of Compute Redactions.fps. Disable queueing in 
		<b>4</b> of them.</li>
        	<li>Run all 5. When processing has finished, confirm that the summary tab 
		of the DB Admin displays the correct statistics.</li>
<p>
        	<li>Reset all files to pending.</li>
        	<li>Create a single FAM instance with a single <b>Set file action status 
		in db</b> task.</li>
        	<li>Run that FAM. While it is running, refresh the summary tab of the DB 
		Admin.</li>
        	<li>Confirm that the statistics are correctly reported when processing has 
		finished.</li>
    	</ul></li>
<p>
    	<li><b>[LegacyRC #5924]</b> Queueing from multiple FAMs
    	<ul>
        	<li>Create a folder containing ~10,000 images.</li>
        	<li>Open 6 FAM instances configured to queue all the images in the image 
		folder to the same database.</li>
        	<li>Run them all. Confirm that all files are queued and no errors are seen.</li>
<p>
        	<li>Clear the database.</li>
        	<li>Configure 3 FAM instances to queue distinct subsets of the images to the same 
        	database.</li>
        	<li>Run them all. Confirm that all files are queued and no errors are seen.</li>
    	</ul></li>
<p>
    	<li><b>[LegacyRC #5926]</b> More database testing
    	<ul>
        	<li>Set up a database and FPS file with enough files queued to process for a 
		couple hours.</li>
        	<Li>Confirm that no unusual errors are seen processing with multiple FAM 
		instances on the same machine using the same database.</li>
        	<li>Confirm that no unusual errors are seen processing with multiple FAM 
		instances on the same machine using different databases.</li>
        	<li>Confirm that no unusual errors are seen processing with multiple FAM 
		instances on separate test machines pointing at the same database.</li>
    	</ul></li>
<p>
   	<LI><b>[LegacyRC #6120]</b> Database Concurrency
       	<ul>
		<li>Exercise the FAM with repeated starting and stopping of processing.
		<li>Exercise starting and stopping of verification, especially with 
		an empty queue.
       	</ul>
<p>
   	<LI><b>[LegacyRC #6175]</b> Clearing ActiveFAM Without Auto-Revert
       	<ul>
		<li>Configure a special database to turn off auto-reversion of locked files.
		<li>Start processing against the database and kill the FAM using 
		<b>Task Manager</b>.
		<li>Confirm that one or more files is stuck in <b>Processing</b> 
		status.

		task.
		<li>Close the <b>Select Task</b> dialog and close the FAM without saving 
		changes.

		<li>Remove any other files from <b>Pending</b> for the relevant action.
		<li>Wait until the auto-revert timeout has passed.
		<li>Restart the FAM.
		<li>Confirm that the stuck files revert to <b>Pending</b> and then are 
		processed.
       	</ul>
<p>
   	<LI><b>[JIRA #12288]</b> Reliability Testing For CreateDirectory and DirectoryExists
       	<ul>
		<li>Make a local copy of the <b>M:\PVCS_JIRA\JIRA\ISSUE-12288</b> folder.
		<li>Replace the local <b>ESFAMService.sdf</b> with the file in the ISSUE 
		folder. Update the paths to the FPS files to use the local testing folder.
		<li>Create a <b>Test</b> database with actions: <b>ISSUE12288</b>, 
		<b>ISSUE12288b</b> and <b>ISSUE12288c</b>.
		<li>Execute <b>QueueForTest.fps</b> via FAM. Close the FPS file when it has 
		finished queuing the files.

		inactivity.
		<li>Confirm that the processing count does not keep rising through 
		several cycles.
       	</ul>
