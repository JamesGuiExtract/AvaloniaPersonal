# 1) Each non-comment line in the file shall be a command statement to the
#    CurveCalculationEngine.
# 2) If the first word of the command statement is "RESET", then
#    the reset() method shall be invoked on the CurveCalculationEngine.
# 3) If the first word of the command statement is "SET", then the rest of the line
#    shall be in the format "VariableName=VariableValue" where the value of the variable
#    represented by VariableName in the CurveCalculationEngine shall be set to the 
#    specified VariableValue.  For Variables whose type is boolean, the VariableValue
#    shall be either 0 or 1.  For variables whose type is an angle or a bearing, the
#    VariableValue shall be a number that represents the angle or bearing in radians.
#    For variables of distance type, the VariableValue shall be a number representing
#    the distance in feet units. For varibles of point type, the VariableValue shall
#    contain two numbers (the x and y values) seperated by a comma.  Valid values for
#    VariableName are: ArcConcaveLeft, ArcDeltaGreaterThan180Degrees, ArcDelta,
#    ArcStartAngle, ArcEndAngle, ArcDegreeOfCurveChordDef, ArcDegreeOfCurveArcDef,
#    ArcTangentInBearing, ArcTangentOutBearing, ArcChordBearing, ArcRadialInBearing,
#    ArcRadialOutBearing, ArcRadius, ArcLength, ArcChordLength, ArcExternalDistance,
#    ArcMiddleOrdinate, ArcTangentDistance, ArcStartingPoint, ArcMidPoint,
#    ArcEndingPoint, ArcCenter, ArcExternalPoint, and ArcChordMidPoint.  Please refer
#    to the documentation in ICurveCalculationEngine.h for information on these
#    parameters, their types, etc.
# 4) If the first word of the command statement is "TEST", then the rest of the line
#    shall be in the format "VariableName=ExpectedValue".  The
#    valid options for VariableName are the same as those mentioned in point 3) above.
#    The format of the ExpectedValue shall be the same as the format of the VariableValue
#    field mentioned in point 3) above, and shall be used to test the value of the
#    specified variable, as reported by the CurveCalculationEngine.  In addition, if the
#    VariableName is "canCalculateAllParameters", the ExpectedValue shall either be 1 
#    or 0, and shall be used to test the return value of the canCalculateAllParameters()
#    method of the CurveCalculationEngine.
# 5) If the first word of the command statement is "COMMENT", then the entire command
#    statement is simply written to the output fie.
