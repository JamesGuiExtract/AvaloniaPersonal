<BR><B><I>NOTE:</I></B>  If you need more information on opening images go to either of the following test cases:

<LI>
Zoom into the bearing <B><I>"S11°26'38" E"</I></B>.  It's just below the center of the image.

<LI>
Set the highlighter size using the 'Set Highlight Height' tool. Using the bearing "S11°26'38" E" for a reference, the first point you pick with the left mouse button should be just above the "S". While holding the mouse button down, drag the mouse to just below the "S" and then let go of it.
<P>
As you use spot recognition to draw, you should see that the height of the highlight is the same as the distance you picked.
</LI><HR><P>

<LI>
Click the "Highlighter" tool.
<P>
The button should appear depressed indicating that it is the current tool and the cursor should look like a highlighter.
</LI><HR><P>

<LI>
Referencing to the bearing <B><I>"S11°26'38" E"</I></B> again, move the cursor near the middle and to the left of the <B><I>"S"</I></B> and click and hold down your left mouse button and drag the mouse around.
<P>
You should see a <B><I>Cyan</I></B> box stretch from the point you picked to the mouse cursor.
</LI><HR><P>

<LI>
While still holding the left mouse button down, press the <B><I>+</I></B> and <B><I>-</I></B> keys on the keyboard several times each.  Make the highlight height just larger than the text height again.
<P>
Each time you press the <B><I>+</I></B> key, you should see the highlight hight get larger.  Each time you press the <B><I>-</I></B> key, you should see the highlight hight get smaller.
</LI><HR><P>

<LI>
While still holding the left mouse button down, drag the mouse so the cursor is near the middle and to the right of the <B><I>"E"</I></B>.
<P>
The Cyan box should completely cover the bearing <B><I>"S11°26'38" E"</I></B>.  If it doesn't, while still holding the left mouse button down click the right mouse button.  This will cancel the highlight so you can do it over without actually recognizing.
</LI><HR><P>

<LI>
Once you have a highlight that entirely covers the bearing <B><I>"S11°26'38" E"</I></B> let go of the left mouse button.
<P>
The highlight should change colors to red and the correct value should get recognized and displayed <B><I>SOMEWHERE???</I></B>.
