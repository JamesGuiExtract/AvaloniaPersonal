1) Get lastest version of $Engineering\ProductDevelopment\Common on your computer

2) Open a command prompt to Engineering\ProductDevelopment\Common folder

3) Type "UpdateAllLabels.bat" and enter

4) Follow the EXACT instructions given by the batch (Usually if it pauses, it means there's 
   something you need to do before proceeding.)

5) When it is asking whether you wish to label a certain project with a given label number, 
   you can either answer 'Y' or 'N'. If you enter 'Y', remember to update LastestComponentVersions.mak. 
   If you choose 'N', you'll need to label that project manually.

6) Once UpdateAllLabels is done, go to the Build machine

7) If there're build logs under E:\temp, rename and move them to their respective folders. For instance, if 
   there's AttributeFinder.log file, look up E:\Engineering\ProductDevelopment\Common\LatestComponentVersions.mak,
   put the correct version number (eg. 1.0.0.40) at the beginning of the "AttributeFinder.log" file name.
   (eg. 1.0.0.40 AttributeFinder.log).
   Then move the file to I:\Common\Engineering\ProductDevelopment\AttributeFinder\Archive\BuildLogs.

8) Open a command prompt to E:\ drive. One easy way to do it is to right click on the E:\ drive, and select 
   "Command Prompt Here".

9) Type 
   - "BuildAll" to build FlexIndex, IcoMapForArcGIS, SwipeItForArcGIS and InputFunnelSDK
   - "BuildAF" to build FlexIndex only
   - "BuildESRI" to build IcoMapForArcGIS
   - "BuildIFSDK" to build InputFunnelSDK
   - "BuildSwipeIt" to build SwipeItForArcGIS
Note: These batch files are for building latest versions only. If you wish to build some earlier version
      of the product, you need to call individual batch file from each product's build folder, and give 
      a specific label number as the argument. 
      For instance, to build version 1.0.0.20 of FlexIndex, open a command prompt to 
      AttributeFinder\Build folder and type :
      AttributeFinderSDK.bat "AttributeFinder Ver. 1.0.0.20"
