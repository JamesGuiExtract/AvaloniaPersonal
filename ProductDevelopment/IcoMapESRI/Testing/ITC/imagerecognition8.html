<li>
In the upper left hand corner of the image there are two tables.  One curve table and one line table.  Create a new
spot recognition for each of them using the 'Crop image and display...' tool.
<P>
You should have two more spot recognition windows.  One of them for the curve table and one for the line table.
</li>
<HR>
<p>

<li>
Draw the map using spot recognition.  You should need to use all three spot recognition windows while drawing the map.
<P>
You should have linework drawn in the ArcGIS environment and there should be highlights in all three windows.
</li>
<HR>
<p>

<li>
Close the spot recognition windows.  Don't bother saving the .gdd files because there isn't much use as the highlights
are spread among the spot recognition windows.
