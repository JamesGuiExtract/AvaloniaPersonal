<li>
Print out the image <i><b>c-pen.tif</i></b>.
<BR>
If you already have a copy printed that's fine too.  It's best printed on an 11x17 sheet of paper but the text you need to swipe should fit fine on 8.5x11.

<li>
Draw the parcel using the c-pen.  Use COGO only if the values are not recognizing.

It might work best using a line feature class.  It's more difficult determining if the output is correct on polygon feature classes because of the extra segment.

<p>

As you pick on line and curve data, the lines should get drawn to the ArcMap environment.

<li>
Finish the sketch.<p>

The lines and curves you drew should get written to the ArcGIS geodatabase and the newly created shape will be selected.
