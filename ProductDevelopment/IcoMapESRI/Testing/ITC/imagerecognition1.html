Set the highlighter size using the 'Set Highlight Height' tool.  Using the bearing <i><b>"S11°26'38" E"</i></b> for a reference, the first point you pick with the left mouse button should be just above the <i><b>"S"</i></b>.  While holding the mouse button down, drag the mouse to just below the <i><b>"S"</i></b> and then let go of it.<p>

As you use spot recognition to draw, you should see that the height of the highlight is the same as the distance you picked.
