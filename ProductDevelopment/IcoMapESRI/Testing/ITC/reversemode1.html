<li>
Set the reverse mode toggle so the linework gets drawn forward. <p>

The reverse mode icon should have the blue arrow pointing towards the right indicating forward.
</li>

<li>
Draw the parcel using spot recognition.  Use COGO only if the values are not recognizing.  Note that the image is rotated 90° so the linework that you create will be at a different orientation than the image. <p>

As you pick on line and curve data, the lines should get drawn to the ArcMap environment.
</li>
<HR>
<p>

<li>
Finish the sketch. <p>

The lines and curves you drew should get written to the ArcGIS geodatabase and the newly created shape will be selected.

<br>Area = ~859214.93
<br>Perimeter = ~3926.71
