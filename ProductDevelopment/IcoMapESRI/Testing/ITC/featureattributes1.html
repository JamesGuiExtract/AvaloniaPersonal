  <li>Create a Personal Geodatabase with a line feature class.
  <li>Create a Shape file with a line feature.
  </ul>
<hr>
<p>

<li>
Use IcoMap to draw the following segments on the line layer:
<br>North 100'
<br>N45dE 150'
<br>Curve to the right
<dd>R = 70'
<dd>CB = East
<dd>CL = 100'
<br>S44d24'55"E 50'
<br>South 150'
<br>S85d10'16"W 241.90'<p>

A polyline feature should get created.
<br>Perimeter = ~803.28'
</li>
<HR>
<p>

<li>
Select the 'Edit selected feature' button then select the polyline feature you just created. <p>

The 'Feature Attributes' dialog should appear.<p>

  <ul>
  <li>For Personal Geodatabase, the selected feature should have both Current and Stored features shown in the dialog.
  <li>For Shape file, the selected feature should have only Current feature shown in the dialog. The stored feature part should be disabled.
  </ul>
</li>
<HR>
<p>

<li>

The new segment data should get added before the last segment
</li>
<HR>
<p>

<li>
Repeat Steps 5 and 6<p>

<br>Distance = 78.22'<p>

It should get added.
</li>
<HR>
<p>

<li>
Select the first empty row and add a curve to the left:
<br>Radius = 62.44'
<br>Delta = 112d22'54"
