You will notice that the .tif image is listed and not the text file you drew the parcel 
from.  This is because the text file was not saved.  This is a change in IcoMap.  Now 
instead of telling the user that the document won't be linked to the feature unless the 
file is saved it records the parent file (the image name in this case) if available.
</li>
<HR>
