ComparePassFail.pl
Purpose:
This script compares the xml output of two runs of the Test Harness on the same
set of documents, generating lists showing:
documents passing in the first run and failing in the second,
documents passing in the second run and failing in the first,
documents passing in both runs,
documents failing in both runs,
for the purpose of determining the effect of changes in rules or Component Data.

Usage:
perl ComparePassFail.pl FirstRun.xml SecondRun.xml [ > ComparisionResults.txt]
The results are output to STDOUT and may optionally be redirected to a text file.

Requirements:
Perl 5
XML::Simple module, available from CPAN

Caveats:
It doesn't like the default xml file names generated by the test harness, so the
files need to be renamed to one word file names. I may or may not fix this in the
future. In general it seems useful to give the files more meaningful names,
for example : "WashingtonGrantorFKBUpdate22.xml" and 
"WashingtonGrantorLocalComponentData.xml".

ExpectedAndFound.pl
Purpose:
For each document in a run of the test harness, to print the tif and eav
paths followed by the expected and found attributes to get a quick overview
of test results.

Usage:
perl ExpectedAndFound.pl TestResultXMLFileName.xml [> OutputTextFile.txt]
It would probably be most useful to redirect the results to a text file.

Requirements:
Perl 5
XML::Simple module, available from CPAN

Caveats:
Currently only FlexIndex 3.x output is supported.

##############################################################################
NoFoundAttributes.pl
Purpose:
To generate a list of files which failed from the test result xml file.  

Usage:
perl NoFoundAttributes.pl TestResultXMLFileName.xml [> OutputTextFile.txt]
It would probably be most useful to redirect the results to a text file.

Requirements:
Perl 5
XML::Simple module, available from CPAN
