RegEx(2): UCLID's regular expression object wrapper around IRegEx object was used to find
          two matches ($1 and $2) in the input text.
UCLID:	  UCLID's prototype for pattern matching with UCLID proprietory syntax was used to
          find matches (instances of ? in the pattern string)
RegEx(1): UCLID's regular expression object wrapper around IRegEx object was used to find
          two matches ($1 and $2) at the same time, by replacing the input string with $1|$2,
          with the idea being that we can seperate the valuesof $1 and $2 later using string
          tokenizer.

Below, each input text, and the corresponding patterns tried is shown, along with the time
in milli seconds, for each search.  Each number below was found by executing 100,000 searches
and the total time per search was calculated.

The UCLID prototype string pattern matching object was just a C++ class, while the regular
expression based classes were COM objects (which has an additional overhead for method invokation)
