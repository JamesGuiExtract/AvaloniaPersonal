	<li><h2><b>Functional Test For Rotation</b></h2>
      	<ul>
        	<li>Exercise the following rule sets using the <b>Rule Tester</b> utility.
	        <li>The <b>RotateTest.rsd</b> file contains 5 attributes that exercise the 
        	rotation capabilities with an included region.  The rules are tuned for 
              	the <b>Rotated2.tif</b> image.
	        <li>Recognize the text via <b>Process Current Page</b>.
        	<li>Confirm that the <b>Test90</b> attribute finds <b>This text is rotated 
              	90 degrees clockwise</b> and that the correct area is highlighted.
        	<li>Confirm that the <b>Test270</b> attribute finds <b>This text is rotated 
	        270 degrees clockwise</b> and that the correct area is highlighted.
          	<li>Confirm that the <b>Test180</b> attribute finds <b>one</b> &quot;UPSIDE DOWN&quot; 
       	      	attribute and that the correct area (top center) is highlighted.
          	<li>Confirm that the <b>Test180b</b> attribute finds <b>one</b> &quot;UPSIDE DOWN&quot; 
       		attribute and that the correct area (bottom center) is highlighted.
       	  	<li>Confirm that the <b>TestAll</b> attribute finds the regular paragraph text 
              	from the center area of the image plus the incorrectly recognized text from the 
       		UPSIDE DOWN areas.  Also confirm that the entire center text area is highlighted 
	       	along with small portions of the side text.
     	</ul>
	</li>
<p>
        <ul>
          	<li>The <b>RotateTest3.rsd</b> file contains 4 attributes that exercise the 
              	rotation capabilities with an excluded region.  The rules are tuned for 
              	the <b>Rotated2.tif</b> image.
          	<li>Confirm that the <b>Test180</b> attribute finds <b>two</b> &quot;UPSIDE DOWN&quot; 
              	attributes and that the correct areas (top and bottom center) are highlighted.
              	There will also be small portions of the side text recognized and highlighted.
          	<li>Confirm that the <b>Test270</b> attribute finds &quot;This text is rotated 
              	270 degrees clockwise&quot; and that the correct area is highlighted.  The 90 
              	degrees text will also be highlighted and badly recognized along with a few 
              	individual UPSIDE DOWN characters.
          	<li>Confirm that the <b>Test90</b> attribute finds &quot;This text is rotated 
              	90 degrees clockwise&quot; and that the correct area is highlighted.  Most of 
		the 270 degrees text will also be highlighted and badly recognized.
          	<li>Confirm that the <b>TestAll</b> attribute finds jumbled text such that 
              	occasional side characters are highlighted along with portions of the top and 
              	bottom UPSIDE DOWN.
     	</ul>
<p>
      	<ul>
          	<li>The <b>RotateTest3D.rsd</b> file contains 4 attributes that exercise the 
              	rotation capabilities where the unwanted region is excluded.  The rules are 
              	tuned for the <b>Rotated2.tif</b> image.
          	<li>Confirm that the <b>Test180</b> attribute finds two &quot;UPSIDE DOWN&quot; 
              	attributes and that the correct areas (top and bottom center) are highlighted.
              	There will also be small portions of the side text recognized and highlighted.
          	<li>Confirm that the <b>Test270</b> attribute finds &quot;This text is rotated 
              	270 degrees clockwise&quot; and that the correct area is highlighted.
          	<li>Confirm that the <b>Test90</b> attribute finds &quot;This text is rotated 
              	90 degrees clockwise&quot; and that the correct area is highlighted.
          	<li>Confirm that the <b>TestAll</b> attribute finds jumbled text such that 
              	occasional side characters are highlighted along with portions of the top and 
              	bottom UPSIDE DOWN.
      	</ul>
<p>
      	<ul>
          	<li>Use the <b>Rotation2.rsd</b> file containing 5 attributes to exercise various 
              	included region and rotation combinations.  The rules are tuned for the 		<b>K:\Common\Engineering\Sample Files\The_Fund\FL - Hendry\Set001\Images\Multi-Page\M\00693.01927.tif</b> image.
          	<li>Recognize all pages of text via <b>Process Entire Image</b>.
          	<li>Selecting the <b>Margin_0</b> attribute in the Rule Tester, confirm that the 
              	<b>three</b> document stamp items are highlighted properly.
          	<li>Selecting the <b>Partial_Address_0</b> attribute in the Rule Tester, confirm 
              	that the highlights are near the <b>P.O. Box 5559 Lake Worth</b> text and that 
              	with the forced zero-degree rotation, recognition was very poor.
          	<li>Selecting the <b>Partial_Address_180</b> attribute in the Rule Tester, confirm 
              	that the highlights are near the <b>P.O. Box 5559 Lake Worth FL 33466-5559</b> 
              	text and that with the forced 180-degree rotation, recognition was very poor.
          	<li>Selecting the <b>Partial_Address_270</b> attribute in the Rule Tester, 
              	confirm that both the highlights and the recognition are appropriate.  This 
              	is a 270-degree forced rotation that finds <b>two</b> attributes.
          	<li>Selecting the <b>Partial_Address_90</b> attribute in the Rule Tester, confirm 
              	that the highlights are near the <b>P.O. Box 5559 Lake Worth FL 33466-5559</b> 
              	text and that with the forced 90-degree rotation, recognition was poor.
          	<li>Selecting the <b>Partial_Address_Auto</b> attribute in the Rule Tester, confirm 
              	that both the highlights and the recognition are appropriate.  This is 
              	automatic rotation - determined by the OCR engine that finds <b>one</b> attribute.
          	<li>Selecting the <b>Six_Digits</b> attribute in the Rule Tester, confirm that 
              	both the highlights and the recognition are appropriate and that an attribute 
              	is found on page 7.
