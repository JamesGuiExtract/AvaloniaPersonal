    <li><h2><b>Functional Test For Rotation</b></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Exercise the following rule sets (located in the automated tests) using the <b>Rule 
        Tester</b> utility.</li>
        <li>The <b>RotateTest.rsd</b> file contains 5 attributes that exercise the rotation 
        capabilities with an included region.  The rules are tuned for the <b>Rotated2.tif</b> 
        image.</li>
        <li>Recognize the text via <b>Process Current Page</b>.</li>
        <li>Confirm that the <b>Test90</b> attribute finds <b>This text is rotated 90 degrees 
        clockwise</b> and that the correct area is highlighted.</li>
        <li>Confirm that the <b>Test270</b> attribute finds <b>This text is rotated 270 degrees 
        clockwise</b> and that the correct area is highlighted.</li>
        <li>Confirm that the <b>Test180</b> attribute finds <b>one</b> &quot;UPSIDE DOWN&quot; 
        attribute and that the correct area (top center) is highlighted.</li>
        <li>Confirm that the <b>Test180b</b> attribute finds <b>one</b> &quot;UPSIDE DOWN&quot; 
        attribute and that the correct area (bottom center) is highlighted.</li>
        <li>Confirm that the <b>TestAll</b> attribute finds the regular paragraph text from the
        center area of the image plus the incorrectly recognized text from the UPSIDE DOWN areas.
        Also confirm that the entire center text area is highlighted along with small portions of 
        the side text.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <b>RotateTest3.rsd</b> file contains 4 attributes that exercise the rotation 
        capabilities with an excluded region.  The rules are tuned for the <b>Rotated2.tif</b> 
        image.</li>
        <li>Confirm that the <b>Test180</b> attribute finds <b>two</b> &quot;UPSIDE DOWN&quot; 
        attributes and that the correct areas (top and bottom center) are highlighted. There will
        also be small portions of the side text recognized and highlighted.</li>
        <li>Confirm that the <b>Test270</b> attribute finds &quot;This text is rotated 270 degrees
        clockwise&quot; and that the correct area is highlighted.  The 90 degrees text will also be
        highlighted and badly recognized along with a few individual UPSIDE DOWN characters.</li>
        <li>Confirm that the <b>Test90</b> attribute finds &quot;This text is rotated 90 degrees 
        clockwise&quot; and that the correct area is highlighted.  Most of the 270 degrees text 
        will also be highlighted and badly recognized.</li>
        <li>Confirm that the <b>TestAll</b> attribute finds jumbled text such that occasional side
        characters are highlighted along with portions of the top and bottom UPSIDE DOWN.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <b>RotateTest3D.rsd</b> file contains 4 attributes that exercise the rotation 
        capabilities where the unwanted region is excluded.  The rules are tuned for the 
        <b>Rotated2.tif</b> image.</li>
        <li>Confirm that the <b>Test180</b> attribute finds two &quot;UPSIDE DOWN&quot; attributes
        and that the correct areas (top and bottom center) are highlighted. There will also be 
        small portions of the side text recognized and highlighted.</li>
        <li>Confirm that the <b>Test270</b> attribute finds &quot;This text is rotated 270 degrees
        clockwise&quot; and that the correct area is highlighted.</li>
        <li>Confirm that the <b>Test90</b> attribute finds &quot;This text is rotated 90 degrees
        clockwise&quot; and that the correct area is highlighted.</li>
        <li>Confirm that the <b>TestAll</b> attribute finds jumbled text such that occasional side
        characters are highlighted along with portions of the top and bottom UPSIDE DOWN.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the <b>Rotation2.rsd</b> file containing 5 attributes to exercise various included 
        region and rotation combinations.  The rules are tuned for the 
        <b>K:\Common\Engineering\Sample Files\The_Fund\FL - Hendry\Set001\Images\Multi-Page\M\00693.01927.tif</b> image.</li>
        <li>Recognize all pages of text via <b>Process Entire Image</b>.</li>
        <li>Selecting the <b>Margin_0</b> attribute in the Rule Tester, confirm that the 
        <b>three</b> document stamp items are highlighted properly.</li>
        <li>Selecting the <b>Partial_Address_0</b> attribute in the Rule Tester, confirm that the
        highlights are near the <b>P.O. Box 5559 Lake Worth</b> text and that with the forced 
        zero-degree rotation, recognition was very poor.</li>
        <li>Selecting the <b>Partial_Address_180</b> attribute in the Rule Tester, confirm that the
        highlights are near the <b>P.O. Box 5559 Lake Worth FL 33466-5559</b> text and that with 
        the forced 180-degree rotation, recognition was very poor.</li>
        <li>Selecting the <b>Partial_Address_270</b> attribute in the Rule Tester, confirm that 
        both the highlights and the recognition are appropriate.  This is a 270-degree forced 
        rotation that finds <b>two</b> attributes.</li>
        <li>Selecting the <b>Partial_Address_90</b> attribute in the Rule Tester, confirm that the
        highlights are near the <b>P.O. Box 5559 Lake Worth FL 33466-5559</b> text and that with 
        the forced 90-degree rotation, recognition was poor.</li>
        <li>Selecting the <b>Partial_Address_Auto</b> attribute in the Rule Tester, confirm that 
        both the highlights and the recognition are appropriate.  This is automatic rotation - 
        determined by the OCR engine that finds <b>one</b> attribute.</li>
        <li>Selecting the <b>Six_Digits</b> attribute in the Rule Tester, confirm that both the 
        highlights and the recognition are appropriate and that an attribute is found on page 
        7.</li>
    </ul></li>
