// Basic input file for Entity Name Data Scorer Tester
//
// FORMAT:
// Two line formats are supported:
// 1) <FILE> | Path1 
//    where:
//    <FILE> = a keyword indicating that the next argument is a filename
//    Path1  = a fully qualified path to a text file with input and output.
//             OR a filename for file located in same folder as TestEntityNameDataScorer.dat
//
// 2) <TESTCASE>| Expected score | Attribute Value to score
//				
// 3) <ENDSLog>| Path2|GroupOnly
//		Path2 = a fully qualified path for a ENDSLog file that has the same format as a ENDS
//				log file. The blank lines in the file separate groups of attributes to 
//				be scored together
//		GroupOnly is optional if it is the 3 token value on the <ENDSLog> line the test will only
//			test the groups. This allows input of a ENDSLog file created from a logging session
//			to be duplicated exactly if ENDS Logging is enabled in the Test Harness.
//			if there is no 3 token or it is not = to GroupOnly the test will be done with
//			both Individual attributes and groups
//
//	Format of this file is
//		Comment lines are ignored
//		Blank lines separate groups of attributes
// 		Each none comment and blank line has a score value and a text value separated by |
//		if the Text value is TotalGroupScore then the score at the beginning of the line is
// 		the total score for the group of attributes since the last blank line
//
