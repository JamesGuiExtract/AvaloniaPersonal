Test OCRArea3 has a couple of issues associated with it:

1) The unfiltered results are worse than they had been. (there is probably some debate as to whether this part should be considered a "bug" at all).

2) When an alphanumeric filter is applied, the output is not including characters that were correctly recognized without the filter. Specifically, the filter is "108CHRISTAOUR", yet 1, 8, H, and R are not included in the output despite being included in the unfiltered result of "10810 CHRsm comT"
