# MICR components will only be split if there is a match for this expression
# Once a match is achieved, sub-components will be identified using the following specific group names:
# 'Routing'
# 'Account'
# 'CheckNumber'
# 'Amount'
# Only these group names which exist in the expression will be available to configure to be split.
# NOTE: After the corresponding text is extracted from the group, all spaces and special MICR chars
# will be removed in the corresponding sub-attribute
