<h2>NOTE: Test results should be archived under I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\FLEX_Index_90\EnduranceTests</h2>
<ol>
	<li><h2>Machine and image file peparation</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Select a test machine.  Various operating systems should be exercised 
		for these collected tests.  Confirm that the chosen operating system is 
		appropriate for this test.
		<li>Install and license <b>FLEX Index</b> or <b>ID Shield</b>.
		<li>Create a local <b>Statistics</b> folder for collection of process 
		statistics.
		<li>Create local <b>Images</b> and <b>Images2</b> folders.
		<ul>
			<li>Copy collected customer images to the <b>Images</b> folder.
			<li>Include some single-page TIFs.
			<li>Include some multi-page TIFs.
			<li>Include some PDFs.
		</ul>
		<li>Prepare multiple sets of the images in order to total at least 
		<b>1 million</b> documents.
		<ul>
			<li><b>[LegacyRC #5247]</b> If enough testing time is available, prepare 
			multiple sets of the images in order to total at least <b>5 million</b> 
			documents.
		</ul>
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><h2>Database and FPS file preparation</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Use the <b>FAM DB Admin</b> utility to log onto or create the 
		<b>Encrypt_Endurance</b> database on a test machine such as HPQC2 
		that has sufficient available disk space.
		<li>Log in, the password should be "a", and add a <b>Test</b> action 
		to the database if it does not already exist.
		<li>Create a <b>Queue.fps</b> file with two Folder file suppliers.  
		The file suppliers should be configured as follows: 
		<ul>
			<li>One file supplier should be configured to recursively 
			supply <b>*.tif</b> and <b>*.pdf</b> files from the 
			<b>Images</b> folder prepared earlier.
			<li>One file supplier should be configured to recursively 
			supply <b>*.tif</b> and <b>*.pdf</b> files from the 
			<b>Images2</b> folder.  Configure the file supplier to 
			<b>Continuously supply files that are added</b>. 
			<li>Subfolders will later be copied into this folder to 
			exercise listening.
		</ul>
<p>
		<li>To exercise just the encrypt & decrypt feature, create a 
		<b>Process.fps</b> file with three tasks.  This FPS file will 
		exercise just the encryption and decryption features.
		<ul>
			<li>Create an FPS file with one <b>Core: Execute rules</b> 
			task for processing.  
			<li>Add a <b>Core: Encrypt / decrypt file</b> task to 
			encrypt the <b>&lt;SourceDocName&gt;.voa</b> file.
			<ul>
				<li>To an <b>Encrypted</b> folder
			</ul>
			<li>Add a <b>Core: Encrypt / decrypt file</b> task to 
			decrypt the <b>&lt;SourceDocName&gt;.voa</b> file.
			<ul>
				<li>To a <b>Decrypted</b> folder
			</ul>
			<li>The Continuous Processing option on the Advanced Processing 
			Configuration page should be set to <b>Keep processing files 
			as they are added to the queue</b>.  
		</ul>
<p>
		<li>To exercise the encrypt & decrypt feature along with archive & 
		restore plus PDF/A conversion, create a <b>Process.fps</b> file with 
		seven tasks.  This FPS file will exercise all three of the features.
		<ol>
			<li>Start with a <b>Core: Execute rules</b> task to 
			process the image.
			<li>Add a <b>Core: Copy, move or delete file</b> task to 
			copy <b>&lt;SourceDocName&gt;</b> to a <b>PDFA</b> folder.
			<li>Add a <b>Core: Convert to searchable PDF</b> task to 
			convert the <b>&lt;SourceDocName&gt;</b> in the PDFA folder.
			<ul>
				<li>Remain in the <b>PDFA</b> folder
			</ul>
			<li>Add a <b>Core: Encrypt / decrypt file</b> task to 
			encrypt the <b>&lt;SourceDocName&gt;.voa</b> file.
			<ul>
				<li>As <b>&lt;SourceDocName&gt;.voa.enc</b>
				<li>To an <b>Encrypted</b> folder
			</ul>
			<li>Add a <b>Core: Archive or restore associated file</b> 
			task to archive the encrypted 
			<b>&lt;SourceDocName&gt;.voa.enc</b> file.
			<ul>
				<li>To an <b>Archive</b> folder
			</ul>
			<li>Add a <b>Core: Archive or restore associated file</b> 
			task to restore the archived 
			<b>&lt;SourceDocName&gt;.voa.enc</b> file.
			<ul>
				<li>To a <b>Restore</b> folder
			</ul>
			<li>Add a <b>Core: Encrypt / decrypt file</b> task to 
			decrypt the <b>&lt;SourceDocName&gt;.voa</b> file.
			<ul>
				<li>From <b>&lt;SourceDocName&gt;.voa.enc</b>
				<li>To <b>&lt;SourceDocName&gt;.voa</b>
				<li>To a <b>Decrypted</b> folder
			</ul>
			<li>The Continuous Processing option on the Advanced Processing 
			Configuration page should be set to <b>Keep processing files 
			as they are added to the queue</b>.  
		</ol>
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><h2>Schedule Reports</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Confirm that the machine with the Encrypt_Endurance database has 
		the desired build.
		<li>Confirm that <b>C:\Program Files\Extract Systems\CommonComponents\</b> 
		(if the machine has a 64-bit OS, instead put <b>C:\Program Files (x86)\Extract 
		Systems\CommonComponents\</b>) is in the database machine's system path. 
		<li>Confirm that email settings are correctly configured on the database 
		machine.
		<ul>
			<li>Open a command window and type emailFile /c to open the 
			<b>Email Settings</b> dialog.
			<li>SMTP should be set to 192.168.44.1.
			<li>Enter your desired Sender Display Name and your email 
			address.
		</ul>
		<li>Get <b>AttributeFinder/Testing/EnduranceTesting/reports.bat</b> 
		from Vault and copy it to a local location on the database machine.
		<li>Edit the batch file, inserting the correct server and the email 
		address(es) where the reports will be sent.  
		<ul>
			<li>Note: More than one email address can be inserted, separated 
			by semicolons.
			<li>Note: The batch file is not necessary to run scheduled reports, 
			(<Server> <Database> "Summary of actions and associated document 
			page counts" /mailto <Address> /subject <Subject>) can be used.
		</ul>
		<li>Use <b>Windows Task Scheduler</b> to run reports.bat.
		<ul>
			<li>Go to <b>Start</b>-><b>Programs</b>-><b>Accessories</b>-><b>System 
			Tools</b>-><b>Scheduled Tasks</b> (<b>Task Scheduler</b> in 
			Vista/Server 2008)</li>
			<li>Create a new task.</li>
			<li>Configure it to run reports.bat and schedule the task to run 
			at least once per day.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>After the <b>Windows Scheduled Task</b> has been configured, confirm 
		that the scheduled task, batch file, and Report Viewer are working 
		correctly by doing a test run of the task (right-click the task in the 
		list and click 'Run').
	</ul>
<p>

	<li><h2>Test Execution</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Open a command prompt and begin the collection of process statistics 
		with the following command string where &quot;Statistics&quot; is the 
		folder created in Step 4 of Machine Preparation.	
		<li><b>LogProcessStats.exe 
		ProcessFiles.exe,SSOCR2.exe,XOCR32b.exe,ESConvertToPDF.exe,ImageFormatConverter.exe 
		5m &quot;Statistics&quot;</b>
		<li>Open both the Queueing and the Processing FPS files.
<p>
		<li>Start Processing for the <b>Queue.fps</b> file.
		<li>Start Processing for the <b>Process.fps</b> file.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><h2>Test Review and Data Analysis</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The following items should be periodically reviewed during processing.
		<ul>
			<li>Processing failures listed on the <b>Processing Log</b> page.
			<li>Memory usage via <b>Task Manager</b>.
			<li>Use xcopy to copy a set of images into a subfolder under 
			<b>Images2</b>.
			This will exercise the file supplier that is listening for 
			new files.
<p>
			<li>Verify that an appropriate file structure is created by 
			the archive task and that the restore task is restoring files 
			correctly.</li>
			<li>During processing, periodically clear the <b>Restore</b> 
			folder to prevent it from getting too big.</li>
		</ul>
<p>
		<li>The following items should be checked when processing finishes or 
		is stopped.
		<ul>
			<li>Collection of process statistics should be stopped via 
			<b>Ctrl+C</b> in the appropriate command window.
			<li>Open the process statistics spreadsheet 
			<b>ImportData.xls</b>.  
			Import using <b>Ctrl+Shift+I</b> the following CSV files 
			from the Statistics folder.
			<ul>
				<li>cpu.csv
				<li>ProcessFiles.NNN.csv where NNN is the process ID.  
				Import the larger of the two files.
			</ul>
			<li>Save the spreadsheet with a meaningful name to include the 
			major version number.
		</ul>
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><h2>Saving Test Results</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Data will be stored in subfolders under 
		I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\FLEX_Index_90\EnduranceTests.
		<li>A subfolder should be created for <b>EncryptDecrypt</b>
		<li>The <b>Stats</b> folder should be copied to a <b>YYYY-MM-DD</b> 
		named subfolder under the associated test subfolder.
		<li>One or more Exception logs can be stored in a <b>UEX_Logs</b> subfolder.
		This is useful if any unexpected errors are noticed during review. 
		<li>SQL Server Management Studio can be used to backup the Archive_Endurance 
		database files to a <b>Database</b> subfolder.
		<li>An example path for a particular test is: <br> 
		<b>I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\FLEX_Index_90\EnduranceTests\EncryptDecrypt\2011-07-30</b>.
		<li>Copy and update a <b>TestDetails.txt</b> file in the YYYY-MM-DD folder.
		This file will contain a summary of the test environment and results.
