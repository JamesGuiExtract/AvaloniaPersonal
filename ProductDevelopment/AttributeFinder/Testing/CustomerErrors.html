<p>
  		<li><b>Test Setup</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Prepare a database and a collection of images for ID Shield processing 
			and verification.
			<ul>
				<li>Use <b>Process</b> for processing 
				<li>Use <b>Verify</b> for verification
				<li>Use <b>Redact</b> for creating an output image 
				<li>Use <b>Cleanup</b> for deleting intermediate files 
			</ul>
			<li>Create suitable FPS files for operation with each action defined above.
			<li>Verify some images and confirm that appropriate output images are 
			created.
		</ul>
<p>
	  	<li><b>Test 1</b>
		<ul>
	   		<li>Verify an image, adding one or more manual redactions and confirm that 
			an appropriate output image is created.
	   		<li>Navigate back to a previous document and remove one or more redactions.
	   		<li>Confirm that a new output image is created that contains the updated 
			collection of redactions.
		</ul>
<p>
	  	<li><b>Test 2</b>
		<ul>
	   		<li>While processing files, run another FAM with a different action 
			that sets files from the first FAM to 
			<ul>
				<li>Unattempted
				<li>Pending
				<li>Completed
				<li>Failed
				<li>Skipped
			</ul>
			<li>Also confirm that this exercise works if the processing file 
			from FAM #1 is <b>cancelled</b>.
			<li>Also confirm that this exercise works if FAM #1 was processing 
			<b>Skipped</b> files and the processing file is <b>cancelled</b>.
			<li>Also confirm that this exercise works if the processing file 
			from FAM #1 <b>fails</b>.
		</ul>
<p>
	  	<li><b>Test 3</b>
		<ul>
	   		<li>Process an image for verification.
			<li>Process the image in a different FAM
			<ul>
				<li>Set the status of the file first to one status and then 
				to a <b>second</b> before processing completes in the first FAM.
				<li>Confirm that the <b>second</b> status is applied.
			</ul>
<p>
			<li>Repeat the above test and stop processing in the first FAM before 
			all files retrieved for processing are completed.
			<li>Confirm that the <b>second</b> status is applied to the files 
			that were not actually processed by the first FAM.
<p>
			<li>Repeat the above test but kill the first FAM before processing 
			is complete.
			<li>Confirm that the <b>second</b> status is applied after auto-revert.
