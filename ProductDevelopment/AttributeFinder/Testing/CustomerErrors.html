<LI><h2>[LegacyRC #4434] - FACC - Exits Without Completing Processing</h2>
<UL>
  	<li><b>Test Setup</b> - Follow instructions in 
	\\fnp\internal\Common\Testing\PVCS_Testing\P13\4434\Readme.txt</li>
<p>
   	<li>Exercise the test at least 50 times on <b>SuperTester</b> or <b>UltraTester</b> and 
	review results to see if processing failed.
</UL>
<br>

<LI><h2>[FlexIDSCore #2482, #2485, #2487, #2488] - Cott - Various Errors During Processing</h2>
<UL>
  	<li><b>Test Setup</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Use the latest rules delivery from <b>PA - Adams - Cott</b>.
		<li>Copy several thousand PA - Adams images to the test machine.
		<li>Create an FPS file to supply and process these images.
		<li>Exercise the FPS file for several hours - at least overnight.
	</ul>
<p>
  	<li><b>Test Results - the following errors should NOT be seen</b>
	<ul>
	   	<li><b>ELI14973</b> - not enough storage is available to complete this operation 
	   	<li><b>ELI06970</b> - unable to create file storage object 
	   	<li><b>ELI03837</b> - COM Exception caught 
	   	<li><b>ELI04367</b> - COM Exception caught 
	</ul>
</UL>
<br>

<!-- *********************************************** -->
<LI><h2>[LegacyRC #4937] - Cott - Delayed-Write Errors During Processing</h2>
<UL>
  	<li><b>Test Setup</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Create a <b>DelayedWrite_Verify</b> database on UltraTester or another 
		server-class machine.  Add two actions: <b>Compute</b> and <b>Verify</b>.
		<li>Confirm that the test machine has delayed-write caching enabled.  This 
		setting is displayed via the <b>Policies</b> tab on the disk drive 
		<b>Properties</b> dialog and can be accessed from the <b>Device 
		Manager</b> window.
		<li>Copy at least <b>100,000</b> redaction samples images to the test machine.
		<li>Copy a current <b>Redaction customer</b> ruleset to the test machine.
		<li>Create an FPS file to supply and process these images.  Two processing tasks 
		should be defined: <b>Execute Rules</b> and <b>Conditionally execute task(s)</b>.  
		The conditional task should use the <b>ID Shield Data File Contents</b> condition 
		with a <b>Set File Action Status</b> task to set the <b>Verify</b> action to 
		<b>Pending</b> if sensitive data is found.
	</ul>
<p>
  	<li><b>Test Execution</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Exercise the FPS file for several days and confirm that no processing failures 
		due to a sharing violation were seen.  During initial pre-fix testing, <b>M</b> 
		failures were seen during a test of <b>N</b> images.
	</ul>
</UL>
<br>

<LI><h2>[LegacyRC #5050, #5078, #5088, #5092] - Internal - File Access Errors During Processing</h2>
<UL>
  	<li><b>Test Setup</b>
	<ul>
      		<li>Locate a collection of several thousand sample images on <b>FNP2</b>.
      		<li>Create an FPS file to <b>queue</b> the images.
      		<li>Create an FPS file to <b>process</b> the images.  Include an <b>OCR document</b> 
		task, an <b>Execute rules</b> task and a <b>Conditionally evaluate VOA file</b> task.  
		If the file is sensitive, set the <b>Verify</b> action to Pending.  If the file is not 
		sensitive, set the <b>Export</b> action to Pending.
      		<li>Create an FPS file to <b>Export</b> the images.  The FPS file should include 
		several <b>Delete</b> tasks to remove the image file, the USS file, the VOA file, 
		and the XML file.
	</ul>
<p>
  	<li><b>Test Execution</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Exercise the FPS file for several days and confirm that <b>no</b> file access 
		exceptions are seen in the UEX logs.
      		<li>Note that occasional <b>ELI24062</b> exceptions noting retries for file reading 
		are expected.  Other related ELI codes may also be seen.
