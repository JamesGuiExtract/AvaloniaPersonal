	<LI><h2>[FlexIDSCore #3609, LegacyRC #5778] - CA - Santa Barbara - DFM : Various out-of-memory errors 
	during processing</h2>
	<UL>
  		<li><b>Test Setup</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Prepare a server-class machine such as <b>UltraTester</b> for this test.
			<li>Both <b>Indexing</b> and <b>Redaction</b> rules will be exercised on the 
			Santa Barbara images.
			<li>Note that separate databases are used for <b>DayForward</b> and for 
			<b>BackFile</b> processing.
			<li>Note that the testing scenerio does not include any verification since 
			the out-of-memory errors were already reproducible.
			<li>Review the multiple FPS files found at 
			<b>I:\Common\Testing\PVCS_Testing\FlexIDSCore\3609</b>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Queue-Process.fps</b> - watches a UNC share to supply images for 
				processing against Indexing rules
				<li><b>Process.fps</b> - OCR's images, runs Indexing rules, copies the image 
				to another folder, copies the XML output from the rules to yet another 
				folder, and sets the Redaction action to Pending
				<li><b>Process-Redaction.fps</b> - runs the Redaction rules, has a conditional 
				task to set Verify to Pending if this is a sensitive document, otherwise 
				sets the Cleanup action to Pending.
				<li><b>CleanUp.fps</b> - sleeps for 5 minutes to give verifiers an opportunity 
				to navigate the historical documents; deletes the metadata XML, USS, VOA, 
				and source documents
				<li><b>Queue-BackRedaction.fps</b> - watches a UNC share
				<li><b>Process-BackRedaction.fps</b> - OCR's images, runs the Redaction rules
				<li><b>CleanUp-BackRedaction.fps</b> - sleeps, deletes unnecessary files
			</ul>
			<li>Copy a set of CA - Santa Barbara images to a testing folder.  Prepare other 
			sets for copying into the listening folders.
			<li>Exercise the FPS files for at least a few days.
		</ul>
