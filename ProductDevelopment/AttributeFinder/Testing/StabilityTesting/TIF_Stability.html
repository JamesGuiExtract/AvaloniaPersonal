<hr>
<ol>
<li><h2>Goals</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Exercise supplying and processing of TIF images with 
		various combinations of machines, FAM instances, and supplying 
		of existing and/or added files.
		<li>Test various operating systems.
		<li>Test FLEX Index and ID Shield using various rule and image sets.
	</ul>
<p>
<li><h2>Database Preparation</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Use SQL Server Management Studio to create a database.  The recommended 
                    name is <b>Stability_3A</b> or <b>Stability_3C</b> or <b>Stability_3E</b>.
		<li>Use the <b>DB Admin</b> utility to clear the database.
		<li>Add the action <b>Test</b>.
		<li>For the multiple PC tests ( 3C and 3E ), the Windows Firewall settings 
		on the machine hosting the database must be updated to add <b>sqlservr.exe</b> 
		and <b>sqlbrowser.exe</b> to the Exceptions list.
	</ul>
<p>
<li><h2>Test 3A - One FAM, One PC, Existing Files</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Create a <b>Test_3A</b> folder that will contain subfolders for
		<b>Rules</b>, <b>Images</b>, and <b>Statistics</b>.
		<li>Select a FLEX Index or ID Shield ruleset.  
		Copy the desired rules to a local <b>Rules</b> folder under <b>Test_3A</b>.
		<li>Select one or more folders of images for processing.
		<li>Copy the folder(s) of images to a local <b>Images</b> folder 
		under <b>Test_3A</b>.  Note that a single file supplier will be 
		queueing these images.
<p>
		<li>Create an FPS file for both queueing and processing.
		<li>Configure a <b>Folder file supplier</b> to supply existing *.tif images.  
		Browse to the <b>Images</b> folder.  Remember to supply recursively if 
		the TIFs are in one or more subfolders.
		<li>If processing for <b>FLEX Index</b>, configure an <b>Execute Rules</b> task 
		to use the Master RSD file previously copied to the <b>Rules</b> folder.  
		<li>If processing for <b>ID Shield</b>, configure a 
		<b>Redact images (no verification)</b> task 
		to use the Master RSD file previously copied to the <b>Rules</b> folder.  
		Redact HCData and MCData items.
<p>
		<li>Begin collection of process statistics.  Use the following command from a 
		command window open in the <b>Test_3A</b> folder.
<p>
		<b>LogProcessStats ProcessFiles.exe,SSOCR2.exe,XOCR32b.exe,AdjustImageResolution.exe,CleanupImage.exe,ESConvertToPDF.exe,ESConvertUSSToTxt.exe,ImageFormatConverter.exe,RedactFromXml.exe,RunRules.exe,SQLServerInfo.exe
        1m .\Statistics\Test_3A /el</b>
<p>
		<li>Start processing with the FPS file.
		<li>Test 3A is expected to continue processing for at least 48 hours.
	</ul>
<p>
<li><h2>Test 3C - One PC with FS FAM and FP FAM, Second PC with FP FAM</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>For each PC, create a <b>Test_3C</b> folder.  On the first PC, create 
		subfolders for <b>Rules</b>, <b>Images</b>, and <b>Statistics</b>.  On the 
		second PC, create subfolders for <b>Rules</b> and <b>Statistics</b>.
		<li>Drive mapping
		<ul>
			<li>Map the <b>Test_3C</b> folder to drive Q: on the first PC.
			<li>On the second PC, map drive Q: to the <b>Test_3C</b> 
			folder on the first PC.
			<li>This allows files to be supplied as <b>Q:\Images\123.tif</b> and 
			processing of files to work from either machine.
		</ul>
		<li>Select a FLEX Index or ID Shield ruleset.  On both PCs, 
		copy the desired rules to the local <b>Rules</b> folder under <b>Test_3C</b>.
		<li>Select one or more folders of images for processing.
		<li>Copy the folder(s) of images to the local <b>Images</b> folder 
		under <b>Test_3C</b>. To ensure that the test runs long enough, a few
          hundred thousand images are needed, so it is likely that you will need
          to make several copies of the image folder(s). Note that a single file supplier on the first PC 
		will be queueing these images.
<p>
		<li>On the first PC:
		<ul>
			<li>Create an FPS file for both queueing and processing.
			<li>Configure a <b>Folder file supplier</b> to supply existing *.tif images.  
			Browse to the <b>Images</b> folder.  Remember to supply recursively if 
			the TIFs are in one or more subfolders.
<p>
			<li>If processing for <b>FLEX Index</b>, configure an <b>Execute Rules</b> task 
			to use the Master RSD file previously copied to the <b>Rules</b> folder.  
			<li>If processing for <b>ID Shield</b>, configure a 
			<b>Redact images (no verification)</b> task 
			to use the Master RSD file previously copied to the <b>Rules</b> folder.  
			Redact HCData and MCData items.
		</ul>
<p>
		<li>On the second PC:
		<ul>
			<li>Use the DB Admin utility to select the <b>Stability_3C</b> 
			database on the first PC.
			<li>Create an FPS file for processing.
			<li>If processing for <b>FLEX Index</b>, configure an <b>Execute Rules</b> task 
			to use the Master RSD file previously copied to the <b>Rules</b> folder.  
			<li>If processing for <b>ID Shield</b>, configure a 
			<b>Redact images (no verification)</b> task 
			to use the Master RSD file previously copied to the <b>Rules</b> folder.  
			Redact HCData and MCData items.
		</ul>
<p>
		<li>Begin collection of process statistics on both PCs.  Use the following command 
		from a command window open in the <b>StabilityTest</b> folder.
<p>
		<b>LogProcessStats ProcessFiles.exe,SSOCR2.exe,XOCR32b.exe,AdjustImageResolution.exe,CleanupImage.exe,ESConvertToPDF.exe,ESConvertUSSToTxt.exe,ImageFormatConverter.exe,RedactFromXml.exe,RunRules.exe,SQLServerInfo.exe
        1m .\Statistics\Test_3C_1 /el</b>
<p>
        &nbsp;or

        1m .\Statistics\Test_3C_2 /el</b>
<p>
		where Test_3C_1 is for the first PC and Test_3C_2 is for the second PC
<p>
		<li>Start processing with the FPS files.
		<li>Test 3C is expected to continue processing for at least 24 hours.
	</ul>
<p>
<li><h2>Test 3E - One PC with One FAM, Second PC with One FAM</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>For each PC, create a <b>Test_3E</b> folder.  On the first PC, create 
		subfolders for <b>Rules</b>, <b>Images</b>, <b>Images</b>, and <b>Statistics</b>.  
		On the second PC, create subfolders for <b>Rules</b> and <b>Statistics</b>.
		Files in the <b>Images</b> folder will be supplied by the first PC.
		Files in the <b>Images2</b> folder will be supplied by the second PC.
		<li>Drive mapping
		<ul>
			<li>Map the <b>Test_3E</b> folder to drive Q: on the first PC.
			<li>On the second PC, map drive Q: to the <b>Test_3E</b> 
			folder on the first PC.
			<li>This allows files to be supplied as <b>Q:\Images\123.tif</b> and 
			processing of files to work from either machine.
		</ul>
		<li>Select a FLEX Index or ID Shield ruleset.  On both PCs, 
		copy the desired rules to the local <b>Rules</b> folder under <b>Test_3E</b>.
		<li>Select one or more folders of images for processing.
		<li>Copy the folder(s) of images to the <b>Images</b> AND the <b>Images2</b> 
		folders under <b>Test_3E</b> on the first PC. To ensure that the test
          will run long enough, a few hundred thousand images are needed, so it
          is likely that you will need to make several copies of the image
          folder(s). Note that the images copied into the <b>Images2</b> folder
          now will not be processed.
		<li>Select one or more additional folders of images for supplying via listening.
<p>
		<li>On the first PC:
		<ul>
			<li>Create an FPS file for both queueing and processing.
			<li>Configure a <b>Folder file supplier</b> to supply existing *.tif images.  
			Browse to the <b>Images</b> folder on the mapped drive.  
			Configure the file supplier to also 
			supply files that are added.  Remember to supply recursively if 
			the TIFs are in one or more subfolders.
			<li>Add a Skip Condition to not supply files that 
			include <b>&quot;_redacted&quot;</b>.
<p>
			<li>If processing for <b>FLEX Index</b>, configure an <b>Execute Rules</b> task 
			to use the Master RSD file previously copied to the <b>Rules</b> folder.

		<ul>
			<li>Processing failures listed on the <b>Processing Log</b> page.
			<li>Memory usage via <b>Task Manager</b>.
			<li>For Test_3E, use xcopy to copy a set of images into a subfolder under <b>Images2</b>.
			This will exercise the file supplier that is listening for new files.
		</ul>
<p>
		<li>The following items should be checked when processing finishes or is stopped.
		<ul>
			<li>Collection of process statistics should be stopped via <b>Ctrl+C</b> in 
			the appropriate command window.
			<li>Open the process statistics spreadsheet <b>ImportData.xls</b>.  
			Import using <b>Ctrl+Shift+I</b> the following CSV files from the Statistics folder.
			<ul>
				<li>cpu.csv
				<li>ProcessFiles.NNN.csv where NNN is the process ID.  
				Import the larger of the two files.
			</ul>
			<li>Save the spreadsheet with a meaningful name to include <b>_3A</b> or <b>_3C</b> 
			or <b>_3E</b> as the test number.
