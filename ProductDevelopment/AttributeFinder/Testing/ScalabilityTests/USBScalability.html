* <b>ID Shield</b> should be installed and licensed for these tests. It is not necessary to install 
FLEX Index.<br>
* <b>Extract Systems LM</b> should also be installed for these tests.

<li><h2>Maximum Rate Test #1</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Purpose, Machine Setup, & Database Setup</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Measure the maximum absolute rate at which a <b>USB key</b> can be decremented 
		through executing a trivial rule set.
		<li>Select a test machine to serve as the image host, database host and USB key host.
		<li>Select a folder of customer images to process.  
		<li>Duplicate the files as needed so that trivial processing of pre-queued and pre-OCR'd 
		files requires at least three hours using <b>all</b> threads.
		<li>Create a trivial rule set that decrements the <b>ID Shield - Redaction (By Page)</b> 
		counter.
		<li>Confirm that a <b>local 25-user</b> USB key is available.
		<li>Create a <b>SCALABILITY_TEST</b> database on the test machine.
		<li>Add an <b>OCR</b> action.
		<li>Add a <b>Process</b> action.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Test Execution</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Create an FPS file to queue and OCR the images for the <b>OCR</b> action.  Set 
		the <b>Process</b> action to <b>Pending</b> after completing the <b>Core: OCR 
		document</b> task.
		<li>Queue and OCR the files.
<p>
		<li>Create an FPS file with <b>Core: Execute rules</b> for the <b>Process</b> 
		action.
		<li>Note the initial count for the <b>Redaction</b> counter.
		<li>Process the files.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Test Results</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Note the final count for the <b>Redaction</b> counter.
		<li>Confirm that the correct number of <b>Redaction</b> counts were used.
		<li>Review the exception log to determine the exact processing time.  Compute the 
		rate at which USB key decrements took place.
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<li><h2>Maximum Rate Test #2</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Purpose & Details</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Determine if the maximum decrement rate is affected by using a remote 
		machine as the USB key host.
		<li>Repeat <b>Test #1</b> using a remote test machine as the USB key host.
		<li>Confirm that the <b>Process</b> action was reset to <b>Pending</b> before 
		starting the test.
		<li>Use <b>SQL Server Management Studio</b> to clear the FAST table 
		before starting the test.
		<li>Confirm that the correct number of <b>Redaction</b> counts were used.
		<li>Compute the rate at which USB key decrements took place.
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<li><h2>Maximum Rate Test #3</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Purpose & Details</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Determine if the maximum decrement rate is affected by using a slow 
		machine as the USB key host.
		<li>Repeat <b>Test #1</b> using a slow remote test machine as the USB key host.
		<li>Confirm that the <b>Process</b> action was reset to <b>Pending</b> before 
		starting the test.
		<li>Use <b>SQL Server Management Studio</b> to clear the FAST table 
		before starting the test.
		<li>Confirm that the correct number of <b>Redaction</b> counts were used.
		<li>Compute the rate at which USB key decrements took place.
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<li><h2>Multiple Machine Maximum Rate Tests</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Purpose & Details</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Determine if the maximum decrement rate is affected by using multiple 
		machines to decrement the USB key.
		<li>Prepare a second test machine with a local database, local pre-queued 
		images and USS files and local trivial rules.
		<li>Configure the both test machines to use the same USB key.
		<li>Repeat <b>Test #1</b> using a slow remote test machine as the USB key host.
		<li>Confirm that the <b>Process</b> action was reset to <b>Pending</b> before 
		starting the test.
		<li>Use <b>SQL Server Management Studio</b> to clear the FAST table 
		before starting the test.
		<li>Confirm that the correct number of <b>Redaction</b> counts were used.
		<li>Compute the rate at which USB key decrements took place.
<p>
		<li>Repeat the above test with <b>three</b> test machines decrementing the USB key.
		<li>Repeat the above test with <b>four</b> test machines decrementing the USB key.
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<li><h2>Multiple Machine Real Rate Tests</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Purpose & Setup</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Determine how the USB key decrement rate scales as additional machines 
		are added to the testing pool.
		<li>Identify and prepare one machine for use as the USB key host.
		<li>Prepare each processing test machine:
		<ul>
			<li>Create a local database with <b>OCR</b> and <b>Process</b> actions.
			<li>Make local copies of the selected image files.
			<li>Make a local copy of the associated rules.
			<li>Create an FPS file to queue and OCR the images for the <b>OCR</b> 
			action.  Set the <b>Process</b> action to <b>Pending</b> after completing 
			the <b>Core: OCR document</b> task.
			<li>Queue and OCR the files.
			<li>Create an FPS file with <b>Core: Execute rules</b> for the 
			<b>Process</b> action.
		</ul>
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Test Execution & Review</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Note the initial count for the <b>Redaction</b> counter.
		<li>Simultaneously process files on each processing machine.
		<li>Note the final count for the <b>Redaction</b> counter.
		<li>Confirm that the correct number of <b>Redaction</b> counts were used.
		<li>Review the exception logs to determine the processing <b>start</b> and 
		<b>stop</b> times.
		<li>Update the 
		<b>I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\FLEX_Index_80\StabilityTests\USB_Key_Scalability.xls</b> 
		spreadsheet.
<p>
