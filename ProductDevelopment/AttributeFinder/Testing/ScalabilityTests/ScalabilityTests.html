<ol>
<li><h2>Test #1 - Thread Scalability</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Purpose & Machine Setup</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Measure the linear scalability of ID Shield processing on a multi-core server 
		(i.e. <b>Zach</b> or <b>UltraTester</b>) as the number of threads is increased.
		<li>Select a different test machine to serve as the image host and the database host.
		<li>Select a folder of customer images to process.  
		<li>Duplicate the files as needed on the image host so that auto-redaction processing 
		of pre-queued files requires between one and two days for <b>a single thread</b>.
		<li>Confirm that the rules to be tested have been validated for the tested build.
		<li>Copy and unzip the rules.
		<li>Confirm that a <b>local</b> USB key is available.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Database Setup</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Create a <b>ThreadScalabilityTest</b> database on the database host machine.
		<li>Add action <b>a</b>.
		<li>Queue the files.  Note that the files must be queued via UNC path or via a mapped 
		drive.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Automated Test Execution</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Review the files and folders in 
		<b>.\AttributeFinder\Testing\ScalabilityTests\ThreadScalabilityTest</b>.
		<li>Edit and update <b>runtest2.bat</b> for processing time and email recipients.
		<li>Create a <b>named</b> collection of FPS files from <b>run.fps</b> as run00.fps, 
		run01.fps, run02.fps, etc.  Note that each file (except 00) should be configured to 
		use the specified number of threads.  FPS files should be created beyond the number of 
		available cores.
		<li>Copy contents of <b>Demo_IDShield\Rules</b> folder to local <b>rules</b> folder.
		<li>Exercise <b>initialize.bat</b>.
		<li>Update the FAM Service database with one instance of:
		<ul>
			<li>run00.fps
		</ul>
		<li>Exercise <b>Configure Email Settings</b>.
		<ul>
			<li>Outgoing mail server = <b>mail.extractsystems.com</b>.
			<li>Provide a <b>Sender display name</b>.
			<li>Provide a <b>Sender email address</b>.
			<li><b>Send test email</b> to confirm proper settings.
		</ul>
		<li>Create a <b>scheduled task</b>.
		<ul>
			<li>Exercise <b>runtest2.bat</b> from the <b>test</b> 
			(ThreadScalabilityTest) folder.
			<li>Run the task at startup.
			<li>Run the task even if no user is logged in.
		</ul>
		<li>Reboot the server test machine to start processing.
		<li>Update the results spreadsheet with values from the emailed reports.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>OLD Manual Test Execution</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Reset the database back to a files queued state.
		<ul>
			<li>Delete the record in the <b>ActionStatistics</b> table.
			<li>Delete the records in the <b>FileActionStateTransition</b> table using 
			a <b>DELETE FROM FileActionStateTransition</b> query within SQL 
			Management Studio.
		</ul>
		<li>Create a Processing FPS file using the desired number of processing threads.  
		Use the appropriate rule set with <b>Core: Execute rules</b> and <b>Redaction: 
		Create redacted image</b> tasks.
		<li>Reboot the server test machine.
		<li>Start processing.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Test Results</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Record the starting and ending processing times in an appropriate spreadsheet.<br>
		See <b>I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\FLEX_Index_90\ScalabilityTests\Thread_Scalability.xls</b> 
		as an example.  An empty spreadsheet is also present in the ThreadScalabilityTest folder.
		<li>The expected result is a graph that is linear up to almost the number of 
		available threads.  As the number of threads continues to increase the improvement 
		in overall processing rate slows down.  Eventually, the overhead associated with 
		an increased number of threads will start reducing the performance.
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<li><h2>Test #2 - Machine Scalability</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Purpose & Machine Setup</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Measure the linear scalability of ID Shield processing on multiple quad-core  
		test machines or virtual machines (i.e. <b>HPQCx</b>) as the number of machines is 
		increased.
		<li>Select one non-processing test machine to serve as the image host and the 
		database host.
		<li>Select a folder of customer images to process.  
		<li>Duplicate the files as needed on the image host so that auto-redaction processing 
		of pre-queued files requires between one and two days for <b>a single machine</b>.
		<li>Confirm that the rules to be tested have been validated for the tested build.
		<li>For each processing machine:
		<ul>
			<li>Copy and unzip the rules.
			<li>Create a Processing FPS file.  Use the appropriate rule set with <b>Core: 
			Execute rules</b> and <b>Redaction: Create redacted image</b> tasks.
			<li>Confirm that a <b>local</b> USB key is available.
		</ul>
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Database Setup</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Create a <b>SCALABILITY_TEST</b> database on the database host machine.
		<li>Add a <b>Process</b> action.
		<li>Queue the files.  Note that the files must be queued via UNC path or via a mapped 
		drive.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Test Execution</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Reset the database back to a files queued state.
		<ul>
			<li>Delete the record in the <b>ActionStatistics</b> table.
			<li>Delete the records in the <b>FileActionStateTransition</b> table using 
			a <b>DELETE FROM FileActionStateTransition</b> query within SQL 
			Management Studio.
		</ul>
		<li>Reboot each test machine.
		<li>Start processing on each test machine.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Test Results</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Record the starting and ending processing times in an appropriate spreadsheet.<br>
		See <b>I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\FLEX_Index_90\ScalabilityTests\Machine_Scalability.xls</b> 
		as an example.
		<li>Create a chart to display ID Shield processing rate in <b>pages per day</b> against 
		the <b>number of processing machines</b>.
		<li>The expected result is a linear graph.  As the number of machines continues 
		to increase the improvement in overall processing rate may slow down due to the 
		overhead associated with additional database connections.
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<li><h2>Test #3 - Maximum Server Processing Rate</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Purpose & Machine Setup</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Determine the absolute maximum processing rate for ID Shield on a multi-core server 
		(i.e. <b>Zach</b> or <b>UltraTester</b>) by modifying the number of FAM instances and 
		the number of threads.
		<li>Compute processing rates for many different combinations and note the 
		combination with the highest overall processing rate.
		<li>Select a different test machine to serve as the image host and the database host.
		<li>Select a folder of customer images to process.  
		<li>Duplicate the files as needed on the image host so that auto-redaction processing 
		of pre-queued files requires about two days for <b>a single FAM instance with a single 
		thread</b>.
		<li>Confirm that the rules to be tested have been validated for the tested build.
		<li>Copy and unzip the rules.
		<li>Confirm that a <b>local</b> USB key is available.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Database Setup</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Create a <b>SCALABILITY_TEST</b> database on the database host machine.
		<li>Add a <b>Process</b> action.
		<li>Queue the files.  Note that the files must be queued via UNC path or via a mapped 
		drive.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Automated Test Execution</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Review the files and folders in <b>.\AttributeFinder\Testing\ScalabilityTests\
		ThreadScalabilityTest</b>.
		<li>Edit and update <b>runtest.bat</b> for processing time and email recipients.
		<li>Create a <b>named</b> collection of FPS files from <b>run.fps</b> as run01.fps, 
		run02.fps, run03.fps, etc.  Note that each file should be configured to use the 
		specified number of threads.
		<li>Update the FAM Service database with one instance each of:
		<ul>
			<li><b>q.fps</b>
			<li><b>run01.fps</b> or the <u>runXX.fps</u> file with the desired number 
			of threads
		</ul>
		<li>Exercise <b>initialize.bat</b>.
		<li>Create a <b>scheduled task</b>.
		<ul>
			<li>Exercise <b>runtest.bat</b> from the ThreadScalabilityTest folder
			<li>Run the task at startup.
			<li>Run the task even if no user is logged in.
		</ul>
		<li>Reboot the server test machine to start processing.
		<li>Update the results spreadsheet with values from the emailed reports.
		<li><b>Adjustments</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Exercise <u>only</u> the desired combinations of number of threads and 
			numbers of instances.  There is no need to verify that one and two instances 
			of single-thread FAMs are less effective than approximately the number of 
			available processing cores.
			<li>When the desired numbers of instances have been exercised for a specific 
			number of threads, stop the scheduled task, modify <b>ESFAMService.sdf</b> to 
			use the appropriate initial number of instances for the new number of threads, 
			run <b>initialize.bat</b>, and restart the scheduled task.
		</ul>
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>OLD Manual Test Execution</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Reset the database back to a files queued state.
		<ul>
			<li>Delete the record in the <b>ActionStatistics</b> table.
			<li>Delete the records in the <b>FileActionStateTransition</b> table using 
			a <b>DELETE FROM FileActionStateTransition</b> query within SQL 
			Management Studio.
		</ul>
		<li>Create a Processing FPS file using the desired number of processing threads.  
		Use the appropriate rule set with <b>Core: Execute rules</b> and <b>Redaction: 
		Create redacted image</b> tasks.
		<li>Reboot the server test machine.
		<li>Open the desired number of FAM instances.
		<li>Start processing.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Test Results</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Record the starting and ending processing times in an appropriate spreadsheet.<br>
		See <b>I:\Common\Testing\Product 
		Testing\FLEX_Index_80\ProcessingRateTests\Maximum_Server_Rate_Tests_80.xls</b> 
		as an example.
		<li>The expected result is a table that shows a peak performance for each 
		selected number of threads or number of FAM instances.
		<li>One combination will be the maximum processing rate.
