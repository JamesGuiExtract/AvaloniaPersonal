* ID Shield and Extract Systems LM should be installed and licensed for these tests. It is not necessary 
to install FLEX Index.
<ol>
<li><h2>Test #1 - Machine Scalability</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Purpose & Machine Setup</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Measure the maximum database throughput as more processing machines are added.
		<li>Select a test machine to serve as the image and database host.
		<li>Collect a large folder of files to process; typically we use the Utah images.  
		<li>Queue all of the images; note that the files must be queued via UNC path or 
		mapped drive. Save a copy of the database with all files queued.
		<li>Configure an FPS file to run a Set File Action Status task. In the advanced 
		processing settings, set it to grab 1000 files from the database at a time.
		<li>Select a group of processing machines <b>or</b> a group of virtual machines 
		for use in the test.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Test Execution</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Before each test:
        	<ul>
            		<li>Restore the unprocessed database from SQL Management Studio.
            		<li>Reboot all test machines from the previous test.
            		<li>Add one more machine or VM to the pool of processing machines.
        	</ul>
        	<li>On each processing machine, start the test FPS file.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Test Results</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Record the starting and ending processing times in an appropriate spreadsheet; see
        	I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\FLEX_Index_90\ScalabilityTests\DatabaseScalability 
		for an example.
		<li>Create a chart to display the rate of documents processed per day for each test 
		configuration.
        	<ul>
            		<li>1 test machine or VM
            		<li>2 test machines or VMs
            		<li>3 test machines or VMs
            		<li>4 test machines or VMs
            		<li>5 test machines or VMs
            		<li>6 test machines or VMs
            		<li>7 test machines or VMs
            		<li>8 test machines or VMs
        	</ul>
    	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Test #2 - Database Scalability</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Purpose & Machine Setup</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Measure the maximum database throughput as a continuous stream of images 
		are provided.
		<li>Select a test machine to serve as the image and database host.
		<li>Collect a large folder of files to process; typically we use the Utah images.  
		<li>Queue all of the images; note that the files must be queued via UNC path or 
		mapped drive. Save a copy of the database with all files queued.
		<li>Configure an FPS file to run a Set File Action Status task. In the advanced 
		processing settings, set it to grab 1000 files from the database at a time.
		<li>Select a group of processing machines <b>or</b> a group of virtual machines 
		for use in the test.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Test Execution</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Before each test:
        	<ul>
            		<li>Restore the unprocessed database from SQL Management Studio.
            		<li>Reboot all test machines from the previous test.
            		<li>Add one more machine or VM to the pool of processing machines.
        	</ul>
        	<li>On each processing machine, start the test FPS file.
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Test #3 - Database Performance</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Purpose & Machine Setup</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Confirm that FAM processing and <b>DB Admin</b> can handle an extremely 
		large database.
		<li>Select a test machine to serve as the image and database host.
		<li>Install and license the <b>full</b> version of SQL Server.
		<li>Exercise <b>Setup.bat</b> from the <b>DB_Scalability</b> folder.
		<li>Confirm presence of required database.
		<ul>
			<li>Name = <b>DB_Scalability</b>
			<li>Action = <b>Action1</b>
			<li>Action = <b>Action2</b>
			<li>Action = <b>Action3</b>
		</ul>
		<li>Confirm presence of 1000 image files in the <b>Images</b> folder.
		<li>Confirm that each FPS file opens without error.
		<ul>
			<li>Queue.fps
			<li>Action1.fps
			<li>Action2.fps
			<li>Action3.fps
		</ul>
		<li>Configure the FAM service to execute each of the FPS files.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Test Execution</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Start the FAM service.
		<li>Confirm that processing continues automatically.
		<li>Track the total number of completed files for each day of processing.
		<li>Confirm that no unusual items are found in the exception log.
	</ul>
</ul>
</ol>
