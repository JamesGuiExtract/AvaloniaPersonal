to install FLEX Index.

<li><h2>Test #1 - Machine Scalability</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Purpose & Machine Setup</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Measure the maximum database throughput as more processing machines are added to the
        database.
		<li>Select a test machine to serve as the image and database host.
		<li>Collect a large folder of files to process; typically we use the Utah images.  
		<li>Queue all of the images; note that the files must be queued via UNC path or mapped
        drive. Save a copy of the database with all files queued.
		<li>Configure an FPS file to run a Set File Action Status task. In the advanced processing
        settings, set it to grab 1000 files from the database at a time.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Test Execution</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Before each test:
        <ul>
            <li>Delete the old database and replace it with a clean copy with all files queued.
            <li>Reboot all test machines from the previous test.
            <li>Add one more machine to the pool of processing machines.
        </ul>
        <li>On each processing machine, start the test FPS file.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Test Results</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Record the starting and ending processing times in an appropriate spreadsheet; see
        I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\FLEX_Index_90\ScalabilityTests\MachineScalability for an
        example.
        <br>
		<li>Create a chart to display the rate of documents processed per day for each test
        configuration.
    </ul>
</ul>
