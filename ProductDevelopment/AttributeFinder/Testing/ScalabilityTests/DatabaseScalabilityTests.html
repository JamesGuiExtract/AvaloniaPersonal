* ID Shield and Extract Systems LM should be installed and licensed for these tests. It is not necessary 
to install FLEX Index.
<ol>
<li><h2>Test #1 - Machine Scalability</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Purpose & Machine Setup</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Measure the maximum database throughput as more processing machines are added.
		<li>Select a test machine to serve as the image and database host.
		<li>Collect a large folder of files to process; typically we use the Utah images.  
		<li>Queue all of the images; note that the files must be queued via UNC path or 
		mapped drive. Save a copy of the database with all files queued.
		<li>Configure an FPS file to run a Set File Action Status task. In the advanced 
		processing settings, set it to grab 1000 files from the database at a time.
		<li>Select a group of processing machines <b>or</b> a group of virtual machines 
		for use in the test.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Test Execution</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Before each test:
        	<ul>
            		<li>Restore the unprocessed database from SQL Management Studio.
            		<li>Reboot all test machines from the previous test.
            		<li>Add one more machine or VM to the pool of processing machines.
        	</ul>
        	<li>On each processing machine, start the test FPS file.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Test Results</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Record the starting and ending processing times in an appropriate spreadsheet; see
        	I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\FLEX_Index_90\ScalabilityTests\DatabaseScalability 
		for an example.
		<li>Create a chart to display the rate of documents processed per day for each test 
		configuration.
        	<ul>
            		<li>1 test machine or VM
            		<li>2 test machines or VMs
            		<li>3 test machines or VMs
            		<li>4 test machines or VMs
            		<li>5 test machines or VMs
            		<li>6 test machines or VMs
            		<li>7 test machines or VMs
            		<li>8 test machines or VMs
        	</ul>
    	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Test #2 - Database Scalability</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Purpose & Machine Setup</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Measure the maximum database throughput as a continuous stream of images 
		are provided.
		<li>Select a test machine to serve as the image and database host.
		<li>Collect a large folder of files to process; typically we use the Utah images.  
		<li>Queue all of the images; note that the files must be queued via UNC path or 
		mapped drive. Save a copy of the database with all files queued.
		<li>Configure an FPS file to run a Set File Action Status task. In the advanced 
		processing settings, set it to grab 1000 files from the database at a time.
		<li>Select a group of processing machines <b>or</b> a group of virtual machines 
		for use in the test.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><b>Test Execution</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Before each test:
        	<ul>
            		<li>Restore the unprocessed database from SQL Management Studio.
            		<li>Reboot all test machines from the previous test.
            		<li>Add one more machine or VM to the pool of processing machines.
        	</ul>
        	<li>On each processing machine, start the test FPS file.
