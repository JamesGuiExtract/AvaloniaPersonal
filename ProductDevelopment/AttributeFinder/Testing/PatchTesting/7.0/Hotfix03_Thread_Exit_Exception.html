<h1> FLEX Index / ID Shield 7.0 Hotfix 03 Testing </h1>
<hr>

<h3>Purpose and Details</h3>
<ul>
   	<LI><b>Customer:</b> CA - Stanislaus - AtPac
   	<LI><b>SCRs:</b> FlexIDSCore #3478, EngTODOs #3
   	<LI><b>Issue:</b> Exceptions during processing can occur when files on 
	the Completed list are removed because the history limit is reached.  If the file 
	is being processed at the time or is Pending, the other task details are unavailable 
	for the upcoming transition.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Hotfix Tests</h3>
<OL>
	<LI><b>Test #1</b> - Invalid task id
	<ul>
		<li>Create a <b>Queuing</b> FPS file to listen to a specific folder.
		<li>Create a <b>Processing</b> FPS file to OCR images and execute rules 
		for the supplied images.
		<li>Set the size of the <b>History</b> to 10 files.
		<li>Supply and Process <b>2</b> files.
		<li>Supply and Process <b>6</b> more files.
		<li>Supply and Process the original <b>2</b> files again.
		<li>Supply and Process <b>15</b> new files.
		<li>Errors are expected as the second processing instances of the original 2 files 
		are removed from the history queue.  This should happen as the 9th and 10th of 
		the new files are going through processing.
<p>
		<li>Exercise the scenario on a stock <b>7.0.0.39</b> installation.
		<li>Confirm that <b>ELI24633</b> exceptions were seen with Debug information 
		as <b>LastCodePos = MLI02389.520</b>.
		<li>Exercise the scenario on a <b>7.0.0.39 + Hotfix #3</b> installation.
		<li>Confirm that processing finishes without error.  An Application Trace 
		exception should be logged for <b>ELI25353 - Task id not found in map.</b>
       	</ul>
   	</LI>
<p>
	<LI><b>Test #2</b> - File removed from history list while being processed
	<ul>
		<li>Create a <b>Queuing</b> FPS file to listen to a specific folder.
		<li>Create a <b>Processing</b> FPS file to OCR images and execute rules 
		for the supplied images.
		<li>Set the size of the <b>History</b> to 10 files.
		<li>Supply and Process <b>9</b> small files plus <b>1</b> relatively large file.
		<li>Supply and Process <b>9</b> new files.  This causes the slow file to be 
		the next file to be removed from the <b>History</b> collection.
		<li>Resupply and reprocess the same large file <b>1</b> more time.
		<li>While the large file is processing, supply <b>4</b> more files from the 
		original set.
		<li>As the first of these original files finishes processing, the history 
		record for the large file will be removed.  Errors will be logged (frequently) 
		each time status updates are attempted.
<p>
		<li>Exercise the scenario on a stock <b>7.0.0.39</b> installation.
		<li>Confirm that lots of <b>Invalid task id</b> exceptions were seen.
		<li>Exercise the scenario on a <b>7.0.0.39 + Hotfix #3</b> installation.
		<li>Confirm that processing finishes without error.  An Application Trace 
		exception should be logged for <b>ELI25355 - Task cannot be removed.</b>
       	</ul>
   	</LI>
<p>
	<LI><b>Test #3</b> - File removed from history list while in Pending state
	<ul>
		<li>Create a <b>Queuing</b> FPS file to listen to a specific folder.
		<li>Create a <b>Processing</b> FPS file to OCR images and execute rules 
		for the supplied images.
		<li>Set the size of the <b>History</b> to 10 files.
		<li>Supply and Process <b>4</b> files.
		<li>Supply and Process <b>5</b> different files.
		<li>Resupply and reprocess the same <b>5</b> files.  This will finish filling 
		the history collection and remove the first four files from the history.
		<li>Supply and Process <b>4</b> relatively large files where OCR and rule 
		execution take about one minute.
		<li>While the slow files are processing, resupply and reprocess the previous 
		<b>9</b> files.  This is expected to cause the first four files to begin 
		processing first since those have smaller file IDs.  
		<li>As the first four files finish processing, they will push history entries 
		off for the next five files.  Since these files are in <b>Pending</b> state, 
		each thread will try and fail to transition the file to <b>Processing</b>.
		<li>Note that this scenario is difficult to set up due to files being provided 
		for processing in an uncertain order.
<p>
		<li>Exercise the scenario on a stock <b>7.0.0.39</b> installation.
		<li>Confirm that each thread fails and stops processing.
		<li>Exercise the scenario on a <b>7.0.0.39 + Hotfix #3</b> installation.
		<li>Confirm that processing finishes without error. 
       	</ul>
