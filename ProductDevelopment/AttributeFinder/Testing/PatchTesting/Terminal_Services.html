<h1> FLEX Index / ID Shield 8.0.1.x<br> Terminal Services Testing </h1>
<hr>

<h3>Purpose and Details</h3>
<ul>
   	<LI><b>Customer:</b> CA - Santa Barbara - DFM
   	<LI><b>SCRs:</b> FlexIDSCore #4264
   	<LI><b>Issue:</b> The customer is processing images and running multiple verification 
	instances on the same server via Terminal Services.  Problems with the named mutex 
	used in 8.0.0.70 result in only one verification user being able to run at a time.  
	Further testing indicated that only one user can open the UEX Viewer at a time.
   	<LI><b>Solution:</b> Code was added to adjust the security descriptor for the named 
	mutex.
</ul>
