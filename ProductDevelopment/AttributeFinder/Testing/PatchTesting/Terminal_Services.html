<h1> FLEX Index / ID Shield 8.0.1.106<br>Patch/Upgrade Testing </h1>
<hr>

<h3>Purpose and Details</h3>
<ul>
   	<LI><b>SCRs:</b> FlexIDSCore #4248, #4261, #4264, #4269, DotNet #452, #453
   	<LI><b>Issue:</b> The customer is processing images and running multiple verification 
	instances on the same server via Terminal Services.  Problems with the named mutex 
	used in 8.0.0.70 result in only one verification user being able to run at a time.  
	Further testing indicated that only one user can open the UEX Viewer at a time.
	<li><b>Second issue:</b> During testing it was found that the FAM service was rapidly 
	spawning new <b>FAMProcess.exe</b> instances.  In some cases, orphaned 
	<b>FAMProcess.exe</b> instances were also noted.
	<LI><b>Third issue:</b> During verification of the HI project PDF's it was discovered
	that some of the PDF's showed up with blank pages when displayed in the .Net image
	viewer.  They were not blank in our legacy viewer or when viewed in Adobe Reader.
	The same pages OCR'd just fine and some of them contained sensitive data.
	<LI><b>Fourth issue:</b> Some rule objects caused invalid page number exceptions when executed
	on a document containing over 255 pages.
   	<LI><b>Solution:</b> Code was added to adjust the security descriptor for the named 
	mutex.  The FAM service code was restructured to avoid problems when processing 
	specified numbers of files. The .Net ImageReader class was modified to load PDF's
	with a resolution of 300 dpi and a bit depth of 24 bits per pixel (this mirrors the
	behavior in our legacy C++ imaging program). CreatePseudoSpatial string was modified to
	pass the page number as an unsigned short (max value 65535) as opposed to an unsigned
	char (max value 255).
