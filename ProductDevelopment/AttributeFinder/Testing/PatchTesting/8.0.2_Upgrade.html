<h1> FLEX Index / ID Shield 8.0.2<br>Patch/Upgrade Testing </h1>
<hr>

<h3>Purpose and Details</h3>
<ul>
   	<LI><b>SCRs:</b> LRCAU #5830 & #5845 
	<LI><b>Issue:</b> CreateMultiPageImage when a machine is busy and we are
	creating a large image sometimes the image has an incorrect number of pages.</li>
	<li><b>Second issue:</b> Add support for 4 and 5 digit file extensions (.0001 & .00001).</li>
	<LI><b>Solution:</b> CreateMultiPageImage was updated to create the new image one page at a time
	rather than writing the whole image into memory and then streaming it to disk.  It has also
	been updated to process to a temporary file and only copy the temporary file to the destination
	if there were no errors and the correct number of pages were written out.  The utility has also
	been modified to report failures on the command line as well as logging a more clear top level
	exception to the exception file so that files that failed can easily be exported from the UEX
	log.  Support has been added to look for both 4 digit and 5 digit page number extensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Tests</h3>
<OL>
	<LI><b>Installation</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Confirm that the installation batch file runs without error.
		<li>Confirm that the batch file can be run from a drive other than the
		drive containing the CommonComponents folder (i.e. if the CommonComponents
		folder is on the C drive, confirm that the install can be run on the D drive).
		<li>Confirm that the batch file can be run from a folder within the Extract Systems
		folder in ProgramFiles (Joe and Mike sometimes create a folder parallel to
		CommonComponents called Patches with subfolders for each patch applied and
		will run the install.bat from the subfolder).
		<li>Confirm that updated files exist on the test machine.
	</ul>

	<LI><b>Testing</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Excercise the <a href="../SanityTests/SanityTests.html">Sanity Test</a>
		checklist on a 32 bit desktop OS.</li>
		<li>Excercise the <a href="../SanityTests/SanityTests.html">Sanity Test</a>
		checklist on a 64 bit server OS.</li>
		<li>While the sanity test is running, excercise the
		<a href="../../../Utils\CreateMultiPageImage\InteractiveTest\CreateMultiPageImage.html">Create Multi Page Image</a>
		checklist on the same machine. <b>NOTE:</b>You only need to excercise the Create multi page image tests from
		the checklist, not the Split multi page image section.</li>
