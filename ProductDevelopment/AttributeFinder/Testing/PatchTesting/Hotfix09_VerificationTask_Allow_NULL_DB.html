<h1> FLEX Index / ID Shield 7.0 Hotfix 09 Testing </h1>
<hr>

<h3>Purpose and Details</h3>
<ul>
   	<LI><b>Customer:</b> Priton Group
   	<LI><b>SCRs:</b> FlexIDSCore #3627
   	<LI><b>Issue:</b> This customer would like to use our Redaction Verification user interface 
	without a back-end database.  The current verification task requires a database pointer 
	so that the ID Shield data table can be updated appropriately.  Modify the relevant code 
	so that for a NULL database pointer, the database updates are skipped.
</ul>
