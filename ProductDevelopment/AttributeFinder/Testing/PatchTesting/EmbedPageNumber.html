<ul>
   	<LI><b>Customer:</b> CA - Contra Costa - AtPac
   	<LI><b>SCRs:</b> DotNetRCAndUtils #355
   	<LI><b>Issue:</b> Contra Costa needs a utility to modify a filename and include 
	the count of pages for the image.
	<ol>
		<li>The application shall run from the command line.
		<li>The application shall change the filename if and only if:
		<ul>
			<li>The filename is exactly 200 characters in length.
			<li>The last 6 characters before the file extension are 
			<b>XXXXXX</b>.
			<li>The file is a standard supported image type such as 
			TIF, JPG, PDF, etc.
		</ul>
		<li>If any of the above conditions are not met, then the application 
		shall do nothing.
		<li>If all of the above conditions are met, the application shall 
		change the <b>XXXXXX</b> to <i>nnnnnn</i> to indicate the page count 
		of the image.
		<li>If all of the above conditions are met, but the application is 
		unable to modify the filename, then a message shall be displayed and 
		an exception shall be logged.
