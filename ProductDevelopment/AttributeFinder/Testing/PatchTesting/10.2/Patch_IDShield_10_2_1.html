<h3>Patch Tests</h3>
<ul>
	<LI><b>Patch Installation and Setup</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Uninstall any previous version of <b>ID Shield</b>.
		<li>Install <b>ID Shield 10.2.1.32</b> in the usual fashion.
		<li>Identify a folder for testing BWH images such as 
		<b>K:\Common\Engineering\SecureSamples\Brigham &amp; Women's Hosp\WayneTest</b>.
		<li>Add some BWH PDF images to the test folder.
		<li>Install a suitable BWH delivery near the testing folder.
       	</ul>
<p>
	<LI><b>IDShield.ini</b>
	<ul>
		<li>The default INI file must be modified to support the following.
		<li>Additional types must be counted and defined. <b>Highlight</b> must be 
		included in the collection.
		<li>Three new <b>Level</b> items must be added and counted. They should appear 
		in the following order and at the top of the list of defined levels.
		<ul>
			<li>Level1 = Highlight
			<li>Level2 = Highlight Clues
			<li>Level3 = Manual Highlight
		</ul>
		<li>Specific values for Query, Color, Output, Display, Verify, ReadOnly, and 
		Highlight settings can be found at <b>M:\PVCS_JIRA\JIRA\ISSUE-13365</b>.
       	</ul>
<p>
	<LI><b>FPS File</b>
	<ul>
		<li>The following tasks should be done to exercise the BWH workflow. The can be 
		saved into multiple FPS files if desired.
		<li><u>Core: Rasterize PDF</u> - Modify SDN in database
		<li><u>Core: OCR document</u>
		<li><u>Core: Execute rules</u>
		<ul>
			<li>The actual customer workflow has two master rulesets, one for AFIB 
			documents and one for PreD and SCD documents.
			<li>A conditional task can be used to run the appropriate rules for the 
			document, if desired.
			<li>Just one of the rulesets can be run since the testing purpose may 
			be to determine if the highlighting behavior works correctly.
		</ul>
		<li><u>Redaction: Verify sensitive data</u>
		<ul>
			<li>The sample documents are fairly long so the default settings may 
			deserve to be changed to allow more rapid testing.
		</ul>
		<li><u>Core: Execute rules</u>
		<ul>
			<li>Use <b>renameHighlights.rsd.etf</b>. This ruleset is set as a swiping 
			rule so that additional counters are not decremented.
			<li>Note that <b>&lt;SourceDocName&gt;.voa</b> must be made available 
			to the rule execution.
			<li>The purpose of the ruleset is to rename any <b>Manual</b> items with 
			type = <b>Highlight</b> to be Highlight items.
		</ul>
		<li><u>Redaction: Create redacted image</u>
		<ul>
			<li>The output file must be a PDF since the customer is expecting PDF 
			documents as output.
		</ul>
		<li><u>Core: Modify PDF file</u>
		<ul>
			<li>Add highlights to the redacted output file for each attribute with 
			name = <b>Highlight</b>.
		</ul>
       	</ul>
<p>
	<LI><b>Customer Testing</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Exercise the master ruleset against the test images.
		<li>Verify the test images.
		<ul>
			<li>Confirm that each image includes redactions with various types.
			<li>Confirm that each image includes clues.
			<li>Confirm that each image includes manual redactions.
			<li>Confirm that each image includes highlights found via rule. Note 
			that these highlights should not be listed in the data grid and should 
			not be selectable.
			<li>Confirm that image <b>highlights</b> default to <b>yellow</b>.
			<li>Confirm that image <b>highlights</b> do not have a border rectangle.
			<li>Confirm that each image includes manual items with type set to 
			<b>Highlight</b>.
		</ul>
		<li>Confirm that other tasks work as intended.
		<li>Confirm that output PDFs contain both redactions and highlights.
		<li>Confirm that manual redactions and manual highlights appear correctly.
		<li>Confirm that highlights appear in <b>yellow</b>.
		<li>Confirm that redactions appear <b>black</b>.
       	</ul>
<p>
	<LI><b>Additional Testing</b>
	<ul>
		<li><b>[ISSUE-13390]</b> Confirm that specifying a <b>FillColor</b> for 
		<b>Highlight</b> attributes overrides the yellow default.
		<li>Confirm that <b>Demo_IDShield</b> behavior is unchanged if exercised using the 
		modified INI file.
		<li>Confirm that no memory leak is noted if exercising with the modified INI file.
       	</ul>
