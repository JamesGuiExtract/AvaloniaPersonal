<h3>Purpose and Details</h3>
<ul>
   	<LI><b>Customer:</b> Florida Supreme Court
   	<LI><b>SCRs:</b> 11953
   	<LI><b>Issues:</b>
	<ul>
		<li>When setting the settings for Queuing files based on the value of a 
		field, all files that have the correct field are set <b>To Be Queued</b>.
		<li>The file specification should be effective but is not.
		<li>The <b>[redacted]</b> label that is applied to redactions in PDF 
		documents is sometimes not seen.  This was traced to the searchable text 
		being written over the top of the white label text.
	</ul>
