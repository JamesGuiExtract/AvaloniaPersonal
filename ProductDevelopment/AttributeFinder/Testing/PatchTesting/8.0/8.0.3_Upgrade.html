<h1> FLEX Index / ID Shield 8.0.3<br>Patch/Upgrade Testing </h1>
<hr>

<h3>Purpose and Details</h3>
<ul>
   	<LI><b>SCRs:</b> FlexIDSCore #4278
	<LI><b>Issue:</b> Unexpected exception being thrown and displayed for certain images when
		Split region into content areas rule is being excercised. (<b>Note:</b> This
		issue was more reproducible on Windows Vista 32, although it was reproduced
		on other systems as well). The bug was due to a data object reference to an item
		contained within a vector being passed to a local method that added more items
		to the vector, which in turn caused the vector to resize and thus invalidate the
		referenced item.</li>
	<LI><b>Solution:</b> The code in Split region into content areas was modified to pass
		a copy of the data object to the local method. The local method now returns
		the modified object which is then placed back into the vector at the same
		location. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Tests</h3>
<OL>
	<LI><b>Installation</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Confirm that the installation batch file runs without error.
		<li>Confirm that the batch file can be run from a drive other than the
		drive containing the CommonComponents folder (i.e. if the CommonComponents
		folder is on the C drive, confirm that the install can be run on the D drive).
		<li>Confirm that the batch file can be run from a folder within the Extract Systems
		folder in ProgramFiles (Joe and Mike sometimes create a folder parallel to
		CommonComponents called Patches with subfolders for each patch applied and
		will run the install.bat from the subfolder).
		<li>Confirm that updated files exist on the test machine.
	</ul>
