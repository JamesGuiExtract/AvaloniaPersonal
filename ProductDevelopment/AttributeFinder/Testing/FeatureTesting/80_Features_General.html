       	<ul>
  	   	<LI><b>SCRs:</b> LegacyRC #5520, #5521
  	   	<LI><b>Details:</b> The goal for this feature is to allow the FAM to be used in a Windows 
		service mode.  7.0.0.39 use of SrvAny.exe simply kills the underlying executable when the 
		service is stopped.  This feature will allow the currently processing file to finish 
		gracefully.  This implementation will <b>not</b> separate the file processing engine 
		from the user interface.
  	   	<LI><b>Main Checklists Updated:</b> Yes
