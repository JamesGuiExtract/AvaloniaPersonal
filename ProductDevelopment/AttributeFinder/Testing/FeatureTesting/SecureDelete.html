	<LI><h2>Basic Testing</h2>
       	<ul>
       		<li><b>Copy Move Delete</b> task
		<ul>
			<li>Exercise the normal <b>delete</b> function.  Use a file 
			recovery tool such as <b>Recuva</b> and confirm that 
			the deleted file can be recovered.
			<li>Exercise the normal <b>move</b> function.  Use a file 
			recovery tool such as <b>Recuva</b> and confirm that 
			the moved file can be recovered.
			<li>Use the <b>Secure delete</b> feature and confirm that 
			a <b>deleted</b> file cannot be recovered.
			<li>Use the <b>Secure delete</b> feature and confirm that 
			a <b>moved</b> file cannot be recovered.
		</ul>
<p>
       		<li><b>Registry Key</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Exercise the <b>Core: Archive or restore associated 
			file</b> task using the option to <b>Delete above file 
			after archiving</b>.  Use a file recovery tool such as 
			<b>Recuva</b> and confirm that the deleted file can be 
			recovered.
			<li>Set the <b>SecureDeleteAllSensitiveFiles</b> under 
			HKLM\SOFTWARE\Extract 
			Systems\ReusableComponents\Extract.Utilities\.
			<li>Exercise the same <b>Core: Archive or restore 
			associated file</b> task and confirm that the deleted 
			file cannot be recovered.
			<li>Exercise the retry logic by opening an image file 
			in <b>Paint</b> before trying the archive with delete.
			<li>Confirm that closing <b>Paint</b> within about 20 
			seconds still results in a successful secure deletion.
			<li>Confirm that setting the <b>SecureDeleteAllSensitiveFiles</b> 
			registry key supersedes the associated object property 
			from <b>Core: Copy, move or delete file</b>.
		</ul>
<p>
       		<li><b>Error Logging</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Retain the <b>SecureDeleteAllSensitiveFiles</b> from 
			above.
			<li>Add the <b>LogSecureDeleteErrors</b> key and set it 
			to True.
			<li>Exercise the following scenarios and check that 
			meaningful error messages are logged.
			<ul>
				<li>Process a compressed or encrypted file.
				<li>Process a file that is open for editing 
				in another application and remains open beyond 
				the retry timeout.
			</ul>
		</ul>
       	</ul>
<p>
	<LI><h2>Special Testing</h2>
       	<ul>
       		<li><b>Network and UNC files</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Exercise the <b>Core: Copy, move or delete file</b> task 
			to securely delete files for files on a network drive.
			<li>Confirm that the files are securely deleted.
			<li>Exercise the <b>Core: Copy, move or delete file</b> task 
			to securely move files for files specified via UNC path.
			<li>Confirm that the files are securely moved.
		</ul>
<p>
       		<li><b>Compressed files</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Create some files for testing that are <b>compressed</b>.
			<li>Exercise the <b>Core: Copy, move or delete file</b> task 
			to securely delete files and skip the operation with an error 
			if the file cannot be securely overwritten.
			<li>Confirm that the operations fail and that the files are 
			not deleted.
			<li>Repeat the test without the option to fail with an error 
			if the file cannot be securely overwritten.
			<li>Confirm that the files are deleted.
			<li>Check to see if the files can be retrieved with a file 
			recovery tool.
		</ul>
<p>
       		<li><b>Encrypted files</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Create some files for testing that are <b>encrypted</b>.
			<li>Exercise the <b>Core: Copy, move or delete file</b> task 
			to securely delete files and skip the operation with an error 
			if the file cannot be securely overwritten.
			<li>Confirm that the operations fail and that the files are 
			not deleted.
			<li>Repeat the test without the option to fail with an error 
			if the file cannot be securely overwritten.
			<li>Confirm that the files are deleted.
			<li>Check to see if the files can be retrieved with a file 
			recovery tool.
		</ul>
<p>
       		<li><b>FAT File System</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Prepare some files for processing on a thumb drive.  Confirm 
			that the thumb drive uses a FAT32 file system.
			<li>Exercise the <b>Core: Copy, move or delete file</b> task 
			<b>without</b> secure deletion.
			<li>Confirm that the files are recoverable.
			<li>Exercise the <b>Core: Copy, move or delete file</b> task 
			<b>with</b>secure deletion.
			<li>Confirm that the files are securely deleted.
		</ul>
       	</ul>
<p>
	<LI><h2>Performance Testing</h2>
       	<ul>
       		<li><b>Running Rules</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Configure a DB and FPS file to OCR, Execute rules, Create 
			a redacted image, Delete the original image, Delete the USS file, 
			and Delete the VOA file.
			<li>Note the image set used for testing.
			<li>Note the rules used for testing.
			<li>Note the total processing time for each of the following 
			combinations.
			<ul>
				<li><b>without</b> SecureDeleteAllSensitiveFiles and 
				<b>without</b> Secure delete in the delete tasks
				<li><b>without</b> SecureDeleteAllSensitiveFiles and 
				<b>with</b> Secure delete in the delete tasks
				<li><b>with</b> SecureDeleteAllSensitiveFiles
			</ul>
		</ul>
<p>
       		<li><b>Deleting Files</b>
		<ul>
