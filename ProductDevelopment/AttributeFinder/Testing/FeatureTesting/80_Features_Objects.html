  	   	<LI><b>Details:</b> Provide a mechanism for regular expression search strings to use 
		fuzzy search logic.  Define a special regular expression syntax that is expanded 
		within our software to a recognized regular expression syntax.  Review the specifications 
		in <b>Engineering\RC.Net\Utilities\Parsers\Req-Design</b> for more details.

	<LI><h2>Character Confidence Based Rule Objects</h2>

		score criterion.  This also allows the Entity Name Data Scorer to be used by a 
		selector.  A Data Scorer object will allow selection of attributes (typically 
		for removal) based on their character confidence.
