<!-- *********************************************** -->
<LI><h2>Purpose</h2>

  FAM system tests are designed to test basic functionality of FlexIndex and 
  IDShield 5.0.  The performance and benchmark tests are designed to both qualify 
  and quantify performance using a range of different hardware configurations.  The 
  software requirements are defined in "FPM Scalability Specs.rtf".

<LI>SANITY TEST</LI>
  <UL>
   <LI>Goals</LI>
    <UL>
     <LI>Provide basic testing sequence to be used with each build</LI>
     <LI>Complete test should run from start to finish in a few hours</LI>
     <LI>Test(s) should exercise as much as possible of happy-case basic functionality</LI>
     <LI>Test(s) should exercise a plausible real-world situation</LI>
     <LI>Test should be sized to run on workstation-class or server-class machine</LI>
    </UL>

   <LI>Use FAMDBAdmin tool to create database with three actions { OCR, Redaction, Cleanup }</LI>

   <LI>Create FPS file to supply files for OCR Action</LI>
     <UL>
      <LI>enable 3 of 5 file suppliers described below where folder FS is chosen based 
       on processing power of the test machine</LI>
     </UL>

   <LI>Define 5 file suppliers ( three of these will be used for any specific test )</LI>
     <UL>
      <LI>files from static list ( PDFs )</LI>
      <LI>files from dynamic list</LI>
      <LI>files from folder A ( 100 TIFs )</LI>
      <LI>files from folder B ( 300 TIFs )</LI>
      <LI>files from folder C ( 1000 TIFs )</LI>
     </UL>

   <LI>Create FPS file ( Action = OCR ) to OCR the images</LI>

   <LI>Create FPS file ( Action = Redaction ) to auto-redact the images</LI>

   <LI>Create FPS file ( Action = Cleanup ) to delete the USS files</LI>

   <LI>Use FAMDBAdmin tool to export file lists for each action</LI>
     <UL>
       <LI>file counts should be as expected based on the enabled File Suppliers</LI>
     </UL>

   <LI>Check file system to count number of redacted images</LI>
     <UL>
       <LI>counts should be as expected based on the enabled File Suppliers</LI>
