                <li>Run verification on a multiple monitors.
                <li>Maximize the verification window on the secondary monitor.
                <li>Close and restart verification.

        </ul>
    </ul>
<p>
    	<li><h2>Queued Action Status Change</h2>
    	<ul>
		<li>Prepare 3 FAMs where the first FAM processes ID Shield images, the second 
		FAM verifies the documents, and the third FAM creates the redacted image.
		<li>Verify a document and confirm that a redacted image is created.
		<li>Navigate back to a previously verified document and make a change.
		<li>Confirm that the changes are automatically applied and that the output 
		image is overwritten.
    	</ul>
<p>
  	<LI><h2>Saving ID Shield Metadata</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Confirm that metadata XML is updated in the following circumstances when 
		the user is not saving actual data changes.  The update should include a new 
		verification session node.
		<ul>
			<li>Any time the document is closed, including moving to another 
			document.
			<li>When <b>File - Save</b> is selected.
		</ul>
		<li>Confirm that the number of verification sessions in the metadata file match 
		the number of records in the <b>IDShieldData</b> table.
		<li>Confirm that the session time in the VOA file matches the time recorded in 
		the <b>IDShieldData</b> table.
    	</ul>
<p>
  	<LI><h2>ID Shield Highlights</h2>
	<ul>
		<LI><b>IDShield.ini</b>
		<ul>
			<li>The default INI file must be modified to support the following.
			<li>Additional types must be counted and defined. <b>Highlight</b> must be 
			included in the collection.
			<li>Three new <b>Level</b> items must be added and counted. They should appear 
			in the following order and at the top of the list of defined levels.
			<ul>
				<li>Level1 = Highlight
				<li>Level2 = Highlight Clues
				<li>Level3 = Manual Highlight
			</ul>
			<li>Specific values for Query, Color, Output, Display, Verify, ReadOnly, and 
			Highlight settings can be found at <b>M:\PVCS_JIRA\JIRA\ISSUE-13365</b>.
       		</ul>
<p>
		<LI><b>FPS File</b>
		<ul>
			<li>The following tasks should be done to exercise the BWH workflow. The can be 
			saved into multiple FPS files if desired.
			<li><u>Core: Rasterize PDF</u> - Modify SDN in database
			<li><u>Core: OCR document</u>
			<li><u>Core: Execute rules</u>
			<ul>
				<li>The actual customer workflow has two master rulesets, one for AFIB 
				documents and one for PreD and SCD documents.
				<li>A conditional task can be used to run the appropriate rules for the 
				document, if desired.
				<li>Just one of the rulesets can be run since the testing purpose may 
				be to determine if the highlighting behavior works correctly.
			</ul>
			<li><u>Redaction: Verify sensitive data</u>
			<ul>
				<li>The sample documents are fairly long so the default settings may 
				deserve to be changed to allow more rapid testing.
			</ul>
			<li><u>Core: Execute rules</u>
			<ul>
				<li>Use <b>renameHighlights.rsd.etf</b>. This ruleset is set as a swiping 
				rule so that additional counters are not decremented.
				<li>Note that <b>&lt;SourceDocName&gt;.voa</b> must be made available 
				to the rule execution.
				<li>The purpose of the ruleset is to rename any <b>Manual</b> items with 
				type = <b>Highlight</b> to be Highlight items.
			</ul>
			<li><u>Redaction: Create redacted image</u>
			<ul>
				<li>The output file must be a PDF since the customer is expecting PDF 
				documents as output.
			</ul>
			<li><u>Core: Modify PDF file</u>
			<ul>
				<li>Add highlights to the redacted output file for each attribute with 
				name = <b>Highlight</b>.
			</ul>
	       	</ul>
<p>
		<LI><b>Customer Testing</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Exercise the master ruleset against the test images.
			<li>Verify the test images.
			<ul>
				<li>Confirm that each image includes redactions with various types.
				<li>Confirm that each image includes clues.
				<li>Confirm that each image includes manual redactions.
				<li>Confirm that each image includes highlights found via rule. Note 
				that these highlights should not be listed in the data grid and should 
				not be selectable.
				<li>Confirm that image <b>highlights</b> default to <b>yellow</b>.
				<li>Confirm that image <b>highlights</b> do not have a border rectangle.
				<li>Confirm that each image includes manual items with type set to 
				<b>Highlight</b>.
			</ul>
			<li>Confirm that other tasks work as intended.
			<li>Confirm that output PDFs contain both redactions and highlights.
			<li>Confirm that manual redactions and manual highlights appear correctly.
			<li>Confirm that highlights appear in <b>yellow</b>.
			<li>Confirm that redactions appear <b>black</b>.
	       	</ul>
<p>
		<LI><b>Additional Testing</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>[ISSUE-13390]</b> Confirm that specifying a <b>FillColor</b> for 
			<b>Highlight</b> attributes overrides the yellow default.
			<li>Confirm that <b>Demo_IDShield</b> behavior is unchanged if exercised using the 
			modified INI file.
			<li>Confirm that no memory leak is noted if exercising with the modified INI file.
