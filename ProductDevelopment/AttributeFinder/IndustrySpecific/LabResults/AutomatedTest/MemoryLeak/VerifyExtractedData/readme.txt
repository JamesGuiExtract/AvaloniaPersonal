Verification memory leak test instructions:

These tests use autohotkey scripts. Autohotkey is available here:
http://www.autohotkey.com/download/

To run the tests, first start the appropriate .ahk script, then run the related 
batch file. Note that these tests use the rules from the Demo_LabDE folder. Watch 
the test for a while to confirm that the script is timed well for your machine and
adjust the timing in the script if necessary. Note that AHK sometimes behaves weirdly
with remote desktop; sometimes if a remote desktop window is minimized, the script
stops, for instance.
