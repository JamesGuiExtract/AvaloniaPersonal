	***** SUMMARY *****
	*******************
	The IDSO file contains 4 main sections of data as described below:
	DocumentInfo: This section contains information about the document as a whole, such as the original
		source document's full path.
	HistoricalObjects: This section contains all revisions of any objects that used to exist but no 
		longer exist because they have either been deleted.  When objects are deleted, they are moved
		from the CurrentObjects section to the HistoricalObjects section.  When objects are modified,
		the state of the object (prior to it being modified) is archived to the HistoricalObjects
		section and the new state of the object (after it was modified) is represented by a newer
		revision of the object in the CurrentObjects section described below.
	CurrentObjects: This section contains the current revisions of any object that is still present
		on the document.  See note in the HistoricalObjects section describing conditions under 
		which objects can be moved from this section to the HistoricalObjects section.
	Sessions: This section contains information about each editing session that the original
		source document has been through.  For each editing session, various fields of information 
		are collected - such as the starting and ending time of the session, the user who was 
		logged on during the editing session, and the computer the editing session executed on.
		Please note that the user opening up a document in ID Shield Office and frequently hitting
		the save button (while the document is still open) counts only as one session.  A session is 
		starts when the user opens a file.  A session ends when the user saves an output file 
		from ID Shield Office.  If the user saves output files from ID Shield Office multiple times 
		for the same input file before opening a new file (or closing ID Shield Office), the session
		is considered as ended at the time of the last said save operation.-->
	<!--The HistoricalObjects section will contain all objects that were persisted to disk at
		some point but which are no longer present currently on the document, either because
		the object was deleted or modified in a subsequent session.-->
