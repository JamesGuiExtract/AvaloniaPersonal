<h3>Purpose and Details</h3>
<ul>
   	<LI><b>Purpose:</b> Exercise recent fixed SCRs
   	<LI><b>Details:</b> Recently added SCRs generally do not have official test cases 
	present within the collected checklists.  One part of validating a Beta 2 
	release candidate is to explicitly exercise these recent changes.
