  	   	<LI><b>Details:</b> This feature allows the user to specify a relative priority 
		for processing of files.  The expected situation is for a customer to process 
		back file images with a lower priority than day forward images.  Any time a 
		dayforward image is available it gets bumped to the head of the queue.

       	<ul>
  	   	<LI><b>SCRs:</b> LegacyRC #5520, #5521
  	   	<LI><b>Details:</b> The goal for this feature is to allow the FAM to be used in a Windows 
		service mode.  7.0.0.39 use of SrvAny.exe simply kills the underlying executable when the 
		service is stopped.  This feature will allow the currently processing file to finish 
		gracefully.  This implementation will <b>not</b> separate the file processing engine 
		from the user interface.

  	   	<LI><b>SCRs:</b> DataEntry #729
  	   	<LI><b>Details:</b> When the database is updated and the changes are applied to the 
		rules, it may allow for new tests to be found which the rules did not previously know 
		about. However, due to <b>DataEntry #688</b> the order mapper will be operating with a 
		copy of the database made when the first document was processed and therefore the order 
		mapper may not know of a test that was found.  To solve this problem, every time the order 
		mapper is called, it should compare the modified date of the original database against 
		the creation date of the temporary copy and update the temporary copy when appropriate.

	<LI><h2>Smart tag support for data entry (#1i)</h2>
       	<ul>
  	   	<LI><b>SCRs:</b> DataEntry #749
  	   	<LI><b>Details:</b> A smart tag allows the user to expand small keywords into phrases 
		to avoid a lot of typing.  The smart tags functionality would be invoked by typing in 
		the period character at the beginning of the string, or after any white space character.  
		When the period has been pressed in those situations, a drop down auto-completion combo 
		box shall appear at the cursor location allowing the user to auto-complete the smart tag.  
		The user shall be allowed to select one of the suggested entries using standard 
		mechanisms (e.g. the mouse, or keyboard arrow-down/up followed by ENTER or TAB), at which 
		point the smart tag shall expand out into its user-specified value (read from the database 
		table).  The user-specified value may itself contain expandable functions such as 
		$UserName(), $Now(), etc.  The database should be enhanced with a SmartTag table 
		containing two columns - TagName, TagValue.  The smart tags functionality should work in 
		any control that supports text input.  The smart tags functionality should work in an 
		intuitive manner so that it is unintrusive to the normal typing operation.  For instance, 
		suppose that the database contains three tags - ABA, ABB, ACD, and DEF.  When the user 
		types a period after a whitespace char, that should invoke the smart tags functionality 
		and a combo box with all four tags should be shown.  Then the user types in the letter A, 
		and the combo box should only show the three choices that start with A.  Then the user 
		types in B and the combo box should only show the two choices that start with AB.  Then 
		the user types in E, and the combo box should disappear.  The user can keep typing as 
		they would normally and no smart-tag expansion would take place and .ABE would be in 
		the control's text value as if the user had typed this information in normally.  Then if 
		the user realizes that the smart tag did not expand (when they had intended for it to), 
		and they realize they made a typo, and start backspacing and end up backspacing through 
		the E in .ABE, then the combo box should reappear showing the user the choices that start 
		with AB.  If the user selects ABB and hits tab (or just types in the last missing B and 
		presses SPACE), the ".ABB" in the text should be expanded to its corresponding value 
		defined in the database, taking into account that that value may further need to be 
		expanded due to usage of $ functions such as $Now().  Smart tag expansions shall allow for 
		embedded data fields that are enclosed in double-angled brackets (such as <<TestName>>).  
		When the user selects a smart tag and hits enter or tab, the smart tag shall expand out 
		to its expanded value, and if the expanded value contains embedded data fields, the 
		embedded data field shall be selected (so that the <<DataFieldName>> gets over-written 
		with user-specified text as soon as the user starts typing).  When the user hits tab again, 
		if there is another embedded data field available, it shall be selected (so tha the 		<<DataFieldName>> gets over-written with user-specified text as soon as the user starts 
		typing).  If tab is pressed when no more embedded data fields exist, then the next cell 
		(or next row or control as appropriate) shall get selected.  The main point here is that 
		the TAB key should help the user easily navigate to the embedded data fields and specify 
		their value before moving on to other cells/controls.
