    	<ul>
		<li>The following FPS files are used for subsequent test cases.
		<li>Note that appropriate actions must be added to the desired FAM database.

		<ul>
	        	<li><u>General</u>
			<ul>
	        		<li><b>OCRAndRunRules.fps</b> and <b>ProduceRedactedImage.fps</b> 
				should be added to <b>ESFAMService.sdf</b> for processing with 
				the FAM service.
			</ul>
			<li><u>OCRAndRunRules.fps</u>
			<ul>
				<li>Supply TIFs and/or PDFs from the folder that will be defined 
				as the working folder.  Files should normally be supplied from 
				sub-folders.  Files should also normally be supplied that are 
				added or modified.
				<li>Core: Execute rules - use Demo_IDShield rules or rules 
				appropriate for a specific customer.
				<li>Core: Conditionally execute task(s)
				<ul>

					data.
					<li>If the condition is met, Core: Set file action 
					status so that the <b>ProduceRedactedImage</b> action is 
					set to <b>Pending</b>.  The insensitive image will now be 
					processed by <b>ProduceRedactedImage.fps</b>.
					<li>If the condition is not met, Core: Set file action 
					status so that the <b>Verify</b> action is set to 
					<b>Pending</b>.  The sensitive image will now be verified 
					by <b>Verify.fps</b>.
					<li>Core: Create file to create a 
					SourceDocName.InVerificationQueue file.  ID Shield for 
					SharePoint is looking for this file in order to update 
					processing status.
				</ul>

			<li><u>Verify.fps</u>
			<ul>
				<li>Redaction: Verify sensitive data.
