				with an <b>/ignoreDB</b> flag.
			</ul>
			<li><u>OCRAndRunRules.fps</u>
			<ul>
				<li>Use the <b>Process</b> action.
				<li>Supply TIFs and/or PDFs from the folder that will be defined

					processed by <b>ProduceRedactedImage.fps</b>.
					<li>If the condition is not met, Core: Set file action 
					status so that the <b>Verify</b> action is set to 
					<b>Pending</b>.  The sensitive image will now be verified 
					by <b>Verify.fps</b>.
