<ul>
	<li><h3>Testing Setup</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Identify at least 3 test machines and testers for this checklist.
		<li>Confirm that the <b>Large Scale Repository</b> is available 
		on HPQC7.
		<li>Within the <b>Large Scale Repository</b>, 
		<ul>
			<li>Identify one folder that contains one fewer files than there
			are testers.
			<li>Identify a different folder that contains approximately 
			1000 documents to be used in shared testing between the 
			multiple users.
		</ul>
<p>
		<li>For each test machine:
		<ul>
			<li>Install <b>ID Shield for Laserfiche</b> on the test machine.
			<li>Install FKB update 8.2.
			<li>Generate a <b>Laserfiche Server Redaction</b> license 
			file.  Copy the license to the usual CommonComponents folder.
			<li>Launch <b>USB License Key Manager</b> and point to a 
			machine that contains a USB key (usually <b>Lisa</b>).
			<li>Launch <b>Rule Tester</b> and verify the <b>About 
			Rule Tester</b> button displays the correct version and 
			FKB numbers. 
		</ul>
	</ul>			
<p>

	<ul>
		<li>Using the Laserfiche Client, log into the <b>Large Scale 
		Repository</b> repository using the "user" account.
		<li>Copy into a new directory one less documents than there are testers.
		(make sure to keep a clean copy of the documents in the source directory)
		<li>Modify the <b>Redaction Settings</b> in the Admin Console such 
		that Automatically initiate document verification after on-demand 
		redaction is unchecked.
		<li>Each user should select the folder.
		<li>Simultaneously have each tester press the <b>On-demand 
		redaction</b> button 
		<img src="..\misc\IDShield.ico" align="top" height="24" width="24"> 
		on the Laserfiche Client Toolbar.
<p>
		<li>Confirm that most (or all) testers receive warning messages reporting 
		that some or all of the selected files are locked.
		<li>Confirm that at least one of the test machines finds unlocked 
		files to process.
		<li>Confirm that all files get redacted. They may or may not 
		all be redacted by the same machine.
<p>
		<li>Delete the documents in the folder, and recopy the documents from the
		original location.
		<li>Repeat this test a 2nd time.
<p>		
		<li>Delete the documents in the folder, and recopy the documents from the
		original location.
		<li>Repeat this test a 3rd time.

	<ul>
		<li>Delete the documents in the folder, and recopy the documents from the
		original location.
		<li>Each user should start the ID Shield background service.
		<li>Each user should select the folder.
		<li>Simultaneously have each tester press the <b>Submit for background redaction</b> 
		button <img src="..\misc\submit.ico" align="top" height="24" width="24"> 
		on the Laserfiche Client Toolbar.
<p>
		<li>Confirm that most (or all) testers receive warning messages reporting 
		that some or all of the selected files are locked.
		<li>Confirm that at least one of the test machines finds unlocked 
		files to process.
		<li>Confirm that all files get redacted. They may or may not 
		all be redacted by the same machine.
<p>
		<li>Delete the documents in the folder, and recopy the documents from the
		original location.
		<li>Repeat this test a second time.
<p>
		<li>Delete the documents in the folder, and recopy the documents from the
		original location.
		<li>Repeat this test a third time. (after the final test, keep the documents
		in this folder)
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><h3>Verification - Direct Conflict</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Using the Laserfiche Client, log into the <b>Large Scale 
		Repository</b> repository using the "user" account.
		<li>Simultaneously have each tester press the <b>Verify redactions</b> button.
		<img src="..\misc\verify.ico" align="top" height="24" width="24">

		<li>Make sure all testers have their background redaction services stopped.
		<li>Make sure there are no documents in the repository tagged as <b>ID Shield -
		Needs Processing</b> prior to starting this test.
		<li>Prepare a folder that contains approximately 200 times the number of documents
		as there are testers
		<li>Each user should select a portion of the documents in the folder that overlaps
		with the selections of at least one other tester. The goal is for some conflict to 
		exist for each tester and also for each tester to have some unique documents selected.
		All of the documents in the folder should be selected by at least one user.
		<li>Simultaneously have each tester press the <b>Submit for background redaction</b>
		button <img src="..\misc\submit.ico" align="top" height="24" width="24"> on the 
		Laserfiche Client Toolbar.

		<li>Confirm that most testers receive  a warning message reporting that some or all
		of the selected files are locked.
		<li>Confirm that each of the test machines finds unlocked files to process.
		<li>Confirm that after submission completes on all machines that all files are tagged
		as <b>ID Shield - Needs Processing</b>.
<p>
		<li>Have each user start their background redactions services and use task manager to
		confirm that each begins processing the documents within a couple minutes.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><h3>On-Demand Redaction - Shared Testing</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Similar to the previous test, have each tester select an overlapping set of documents
		such that all testers have some overlap in their selection with other testers yet
		also have documents that no other users have.
		<li>This time, only about half of the documents in the folder should be selected in total.
		<li>Simultaneously have all testers press the <b>On-demand redaction</b> button 
		<img src="..\misc\idshield.ico" align="top" height="24" width="24"> 
		on the Laserfiche Client Toolbar.
<p>
		<li>Confirm that most or all testers receives a warning message reporting 
		that some or all of the selected files are locked.
		<li>Confirm that each of the test machines finds unlocked files to process.
		<li>One or more testers may get a message reporting documents
		have already been processed. The tester(s) should choose to reprocess these
		documents.
		<li>Once on-demand redaction is complete on all machines, wait for background
		processing to complete if necessary.
		<li>Confirm that all documents have been tagged as <b>ID Shield - Processed</b>
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><h3>Verification - Shared Testing</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Have all testers select the folder that contains the shared testing
		documents
		<li>Simultaneously have all testers press the <b>Verify redactions</b> button 
		<img src="..\misc\verify.ico" align="top" height="24" width="24"> 
		on the Laserfiche Client Toolbar.
<p>
		<li>Confirm that each user continues to be supplied documents for verification
		<li>As the documents are verified manual image or text redactions should be
		randomly applied before marking the document as verified.  When prompted to review
		changes to ensure corresponding redactions, alternate between responding <b>Yes</b>
		or <b>No</b> to review the document again.
		<li>Confirm that when the verification process completes for all testers
		that all documents have been verified.
