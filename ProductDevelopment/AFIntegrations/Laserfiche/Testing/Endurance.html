<ul>
	<li><h3>Testing Setup</h3>
	<ul>
<p>
		<li><b>Machine 1: Server</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Use a machine with a server OS that supports 4+ threads.
			<li>Install Laserfiche server 7.2, Laserfiche Client 7.2 and the Laserfiche Administration Console.
			<li>See <a href="LargeScaleConfiguration.html">Large Scale Repository Configuration</a> to set up a repository with 200,000 documents
			and about 400,000 pages.
			<li>Create a directory to store statistics and copy the file <b>I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\Laserfiche\LF_Stats.bat</b> to it.
		</ul>
<p>
		<li><b>Machine 2: Submission & Supplying Machine</b>
		<ul>
			<li>A faster machine will be helpful, but only one core is needed as the work done on this machine will be single-threaded. If 
				a multi-core machine is used, the Laserfiche 7.2 VM and Laserfiche 8 VM described below can be run on the same machine.
			<li>Install Laserfiche Client 7.2
			<li>Install <b>ID Shield for Laserfiche</b>.
			<li>Move the file <b>I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\Laserfiche\Rules\ID Shield for LF.rsd.etf</b> to a directory on the network
			that is readable without any authenticaion.
			<li>Use <b>ID Shield Admin Console</b> to configure the <b>Redaction Settings</b> as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>Redaction Rules: Specify the rules file relocated in the previous step.
				<li><b>Checked</b>: Redact high confidence data.  
				<li><b>Checked</b>: Redact medium confidence data.  
				<li><b>Checked</b>: Redact low confidence data.  
				<li><b>Checked</b>: Automatically tag processed documents for verification.
				<li><b>Un-Checked</b>: Tag all documents that are processed.  
				<li><b>Checked</b>: Tag only documents that contain evidence of sensitive data or clues.  
				<li><b>Un-Checked</b>: Automatically initiate document verification after on-demand processing if
				one or more documents were tagged for verification.
				<li><b>Checked</b>: Upon verification of a document ensure a corresponding text or image redaction 
				exists for all manually added redactions.
			</ul>
			<li>Create a directory to store statistics and copy the file <b>I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\Laserfiche\LF_Stats.bat</b> to it.
		</ul>
<p>
		<li><b>Machine 3 - 6: Background Processing Machines</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Use a machines that supports 4+ threads including one that supports 8+ threads
			<li>Ensure no Laserfiche software is installed.
			<li>Install <b>ID Shield for Laserfiche</b>.
			<li>Use <b>ID Shield Background Service</b> configuration to ensure the <b>Large Scale Repository</b> is visible
			(but do not start the service yet)
			<li>Create a directory to store statistics and copy the file <b>I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\Laserfiche\LF_Stats.bat</b> to it.
		</ul>
<p>
		<li><b>Laserfiche 7.2 VM</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a new Windows XP virtual machine with 512KB memory using <b>I:\Common\Engineering\VirtualMachines\Laserfiche_72\Laserfiche_72.vhd</b>
			<li>Stop and disable the <b>Laserfiche Server 7.2.1</b> service.
			<li>Install <b>ID Shield for Laserfiche</b>.
			<li>Open the Laserfiche Client and ensure it can connect to the <b>Large Scale Repository</b>.
			<li>Add the ID Shield buttons to the toolbar. 
			(see <a href="Installation.html">Installation and Licensing</a> for details)
			<li>Create a directory to store statistics and copy the file <b>I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\Laserfiche\LF_Stats.bat</b> to it.
		</ul>
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><h3>Starting the Test</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Machine 3 - 6 :Start Background Processing</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Open <b>ID Shield Background Service</b> configuration.
			<li>Select the <b>Large Scale Repository</b>
			<li>Specify username "User", password "a" or a user with appropriate privileges to process files for redactions.
			<li>Run the <b>LF_Stats.bat</b> file to start logging
			<li>Select <b>Use as many threads as needed to achieve peak performance</b>
			<li>Start the service and ensure the status changes to <b>Running</b>
			<li>Close <b>ID Shield Background Service</b> configuration.
		</ul>
<p>
		<li><b>Machine 2: Submit files for background processing</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Run the <b>LF_Stats.bat</b> file to start logging
			<li>Open the Laserfiche Client and select the root of the repository.
			<li>Press the <img src="..\misc\Submit.ico" align="top" height="24" width="24"> 
			<b>Process in background with ID Shield</b> button.
			<li>Ensure ID Shield prompts that more that 50,000 documents have been selected and that only 50,000 can be processed
			at one time.
			<li>Ensure any files ID Shield says it can't process are a small fraction (10% or less) of those selected and that
			the reasons specified seem reasonable.
			<li>For all but the first submission, ensure the prompts with the number of processed and failed documents seem
			reasonable and select <b>No</b> to avoid reprocessing them.
			<li>Once the first batch is submitted, repeat until all 200,000 documents are submitted.
			    NOTE: As documents continue to be processed, processed documents will make up a progressively larger amount of
			    each 50,000 document batch.  If more than half the documents or so are processed before the first 200,000 documents
			    are submitted, you can use the following advanced search with the Laserfiche Client to first find all unprocessed documents:
			    <b>{LF:Name="*", Type=D} - {LF:Tags="ID Shield - Processed"}</b>. Press <b>Ctrl + A</b> to select all search results
			    and press the <b>submit</b> button.
		</ul>
<p>
		<li><b>Laserfiche 7.2 VM:</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Run the <b>LF_Stats.bat</b> file to start logging
			<li>Select about 500 documents that were not submitted for background processing on other machines
			<li>Press the <img src="..\misc\IDShield.ico" align="top" height="24" width="24"> <b>Process with ID Shield</b> button
			to immediately redact the documents in the current Laserfiche Client session.
			<li>Ensure processing starts successfully
		</ul>
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><h3>On a daily basis:</h3>
	<ul>
<p>
		<li><b>Machine 1</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Day 1</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Via a Laserfiche Client, create folder <b>02</b> in the documents folder
				<li>Open folder <b>02</b> and select the <b>File | Import...</b> menu option
				<li>Click <b>Options...</b> in the lower right and ensure the following settings: 
				<ul>
					<li><b>Unchecked</b>: Always show Document Metadata dialog 
					<li><b>Unchecked</b>: OCR/Extract text 
					<li><b>Select</b>: (Save images as) one page documents 
					<li><b>Unchecked</b>: New text page every [x] lines 
				</ul>In the I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\Laserfiche\LargeScaleDatabase directory select 
				<b>Large Scale Repository Part2.lfb</b> and press <b>Import</b>. 
				(The imported documents will already be tagged <b>ID Shield - Needs Processing</b>.)
			</ul>
			<li><b>Day 2</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Via a Laserfiche Client, create folder <b>03</b> in the documents folder
				<li>Open folder <b>03</b> and select the <b>File | Import...</b> menu option
				<li>Import <b>Large Scale Repository Part1.lfb</b>.
			</ul>
			<li><b>Day 3</b>
			<ul>
				<li>In the Laserfiche client open folder <b>03</b> and select the <b>File | Import...</b> menu option
				<li>Import <b>Large Scale Repository Part2.lfb</b>.
				(The imported documents will already be tagged <b>ID Shield - Needs Processing</b>.)
			</ul>
			<li><b>Day 4+</b>
			<ul>
				The repository now contains more than 1 million pages and does not need any more images.
			</ul>
		</ul>
<p>
		<li><b>Machine 2</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Day 1</b>
			<ul>
				<li>In the Laserfiche Client, select <b>Tools | Options | New Documents...</b>
				<li>Ensure <b>always show metadata dialog</b> is unchecked and <b>OCR/Extract Text</b> is checked.
				<li>Open folder <b>02</b> in the documents folder
				<li>Open the folder <b>I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\Laserfiche\LargeScaleDatabase\Files\Part1</b>
				<li>Select all the folders contained in <b>Part1</b> (in Windows explorer) and drag them into the 
				Laserfiche Client.
			</ul>
			<li><b>Day 2 +</b>
			<ul>
				<li>If the document OCR'ing process is still going, let it run
				<li>If the document OCR'ing is complete or if every document page is reporting an error:
				<ul>
					<li>Cancel the process if it is still running
					<li>Select or search for documents needing submission
					<li>Press the <img src="..\misc\Submit.ico" align="top" height="24" width="24"> 
					<b>Process in background with ID Shield</b> button.
					<li>Ensure any files ID Shield says it can't process are a small fraction (10% or less) of those selected and that
					the reasons specified seem reasonable.
					<li>Submit the documents & repeat as needed.
				</ul>
			</ul>
		</ul>
<p>
		<li><b>Machine 3 - 6:</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Once Daily (starting on day 2)</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Open <b>ID Shield Background Service</b> configuration and ensure the service is still running.
				<li>Close <b>ID Shield Background Service</b> configuration.
				<li>Check the statistics generated by <b>LF_States.bat</b> and look for any obvious problems.
				<li><b>View Exception Log</b> and look problems.  NOTE: The pre-assembled <b>Large Scale Repository</b>
				has many problems including missing image files and missing spatial info for OCR'd test.  The logs will
				likely report many problems.  Spot check these problems to ensure they make sense given the document being processed.
				(ie, "Cannot find file" if the Laserfiche document is missing the image file or a warning about inaccurate/missing text
				redactions if the document's text is missing spatial info.  The later case can be verified by attempting to create a
				linked redaction using the Laserfiche client-- it will fail if the text is missing spatial information)
			</ul>
		</ul>
<p>
		<li><b>Laserfiche 7.2 VM</b>:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Once Daily (starting on day 2)</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Ensure the "Processing Complete!" message box is displayed.
				<li>If processing has not finished, determine if it is reasonable that processing has not finished 
				(ie, documents with a large number of pages), and press <b>Stop</b> to interrupt processing.
				<li>In the Laserfiche Client, select the root of the repository and press the 
				<img src="..\misc\Verify.ico" align="top" height="24" width="24"> <b>Verify ID Shield Redactions</b> button.
				<b>Verify ID Shield Redactions</b> button and confirm that the verification process is started.
				<li>Verify documents
				<ul>
					<li>Ensure each document displayed for verification either has automatically added redaction zones or highlighted clues.
					<li>On every other document either add a new redaction zone to the image or text or delete an existing one.
					<li>Press the <b>Verify</b> button <img src="..\misc\verify.ico" align="top" height="24" width="24"> on the toolbar
					to mark the current document as verified.
					<li>When manual redactions are added, confirm ID Shield prompts that the redactions were updated to properly link
					image and text redactions.
					<li>After a couple dozen documents have been verified, press the stop button.
				</ul>
				<li>If there are a significant number documents in the repository that have not yet been submitted and machine 6 is busy supplying 
				documents
				<ul>
					<li>Select or search for documents needing submission
					<li>Press the <img src="..\misc\Submit.ico" align="top" height="24" width="24"> 
					<b>Process in background with ID Shield</b> button.
					<li>Ensure any files ID Shield says it can't process are a small fraction (10% or less) of those selected and that
					the reasons specified seem reasonable.
					<li>Submit the documents & repeat as needed.
				</ul>
				<li>Select ~500 documents
				<li>Press the <img src="..\misc\IDShield.ico" align="top" height="24" width="24"> <b>Process with ID Shield</b> button
				to immediately redact the documents in the current Laserfiche Client session. (make sure most have not yet been processed)
				<li>Ensure processing starts successfully
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><h3>After the entire repository is processed</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>2 of the 4 background service machines as well as the virtual machines can be released. Be sure to keep the background service
	 	running uninterrupted on the background machines.
		<li>Reset the repository
		<ul>
			<li>Use the utility <b>I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\Laserfiche\LFTool.exe</b> to remove ID Shield tags, 
			redactions and annotations from all documents in the repository.
		</ul>
		<li>Use Machine 2 to start re-submitting all documents for processing.
		<ul>
			<li>The first 2 times, do so by selecting the repository as whole ensuring that the documents are processed in 50,000 document batches.
			<li>Subsequent submissions can be done by selecting specific subfolder or search results to avoid getting too many processed documents
			in the batches.
			<li>Continue submitting until all the documents have once again submitted for processing.
		</ul>
		<li>Let the 2 background service machines process the second round of documents for a minimum of 72 hours brining the total "up" time to a 
		total of at least one week.
