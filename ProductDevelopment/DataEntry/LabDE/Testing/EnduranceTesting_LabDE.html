<h2>NOTE: Test results should be archived under I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\LabDE_10\EnduranceTests</h2>
<ol>
	<li><h2>Machine Preparation</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Select a test machine.  Various operating systems should be exercised 
		    for these collected tests.  Confirm that the chosen operating system is 
		    appropriate for this test.
		<li>Install and license <b>LabDE</b>.  Note that 
		    Disable USB Key Serial Numbers is required to exercise a customer ruleset.
		<li>Use the <b>USB License Key Manager</b> utility to confirm that a network 
		    USB key is configured and available.  The usual location is on <b>LISA</b>.
		<li>Create a local <b>Statistics</b> folder for collection of process statistics.
		<li>Create a local folder for the ruleset to be exercised and select the corresponding 
		images.  Note: The images need to match the ruleset.
		<ul>
			<li><b>Demo_LabDE\Solution\Rules</b> is the suggested rule set.
			<li><b>Advance Health\Organized\Top80</b> is the suggested image set.
		</ul>
<p>
		<li><b>Image Files</b>: 
		<ul>
			<li><b>DELLQC3</b>, <b>HPQC2</b>, and <b>PROVOLONE</b> each have 
			additional 1 TB disk drives for local storage of test images. 
			<li>Create two local folders 
			(<b>Images</b> and <b>Images2</b>) for images to be processed.  Copies of 
			folders can also be used to increase the number of images to be processed.  
			<li>Copy images from K: to appropriate subfolders of <b>Images</b> 
			before processing starts.  This provides images for immediate supplying 
			and processing.
			<li>Copy images from K: to appropriate subfolders of <b>Images2</b> 
			after processing starts to exercise listening for new files.  
		</ul>
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><h2>Database Preparation</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Use the <b>FAM DB Admin</b> utility to log onto or create the 
		<b>Endurance_Test</b> database on the test machine hosting the image files.
		<li>Log in, the password should be "a", and add <b>Test</b> and <b>Verify</b> 
		actions to the database if they do not already exist.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><h2>File Preparation</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Create a <b>Queue.fps</b> file with two Folder file suppliers.  
		    The file suppliers should be configured as follows: 
		<ul>
			<li>One File Supplier should be configured to recursively supply <b>*.tif</b> 
			files from an Images folder that contains subfolders with preloaded images.
			<li>One File Supplier should be configured to recursively supply <b>*.tif</b> 
			files from an empty Images2 folder.  
			Configure the file supplier to <b>Continuously supply files that are added</b>. 
			Subfolders will later be copied into this folder to exercise listening.
		</ul>
<p>
		<li>Create a <b>Process.fps</b> file with one task.  
		<ul>
			<li>Configure an <b>Execute rules</b> task for processing the images.
			<li>Configure a <b>Set file action status</b> task set the <b>Verify</b> 
			action to <b>Pending</b>.
			<li>The Continuous Processing option on the Processing Setup page should be 
			set to <b>Keep processing files as they are added to the queue</b>.  
		</ul>
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><h2>Schedule Reports</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Confirm that the machine with the Endurance_Test database has the desired 
		<b>LabDE</b> build.
		<li>Confirm that <b>C:\Program Files\Extract Systems\CommonComponents\</b> (if the 
		machine has a 64-bit OS, instead put <b>C:\Program Files (x86)\Extract Systems\CommonComponents\</b>) 
		is in the database machine's system path. 
		<li>Confirm that email settings are correctly configured on the database machine.
		<ul>
			<li>Open a command window and type emailFile /c to open the <b>Email Settings</b> dialog.
			<li>SMTP should be set to 192.168.44.1.
			<li>Enter your desired Sender Display Name and your email address.
		</ul>
		<li>Get <b>AttributeFinder/Testing/EnduranceTesting/reports.bat</b> from Vault and copy 
		it to a local location on the database machine.
		<li>Edit the batch file, inserting the correct server and the email address(es) where 
		the reports will be sent.  Note: More than one email address can be inserted, 
		separated by semicolons.
		<li>Use <b>Windows Task Scheduler</b> to run reports.bat.
		<ul>
			<li>Go to <b>Start</b>-><b>Programs</b>-><b>Accessories</b>-><b>System
			Tools</b>-><b>Scheduled Tasks</b> (<b>Task Scheduler</b> in 
			Vista/Server 2008)</li>
			<li>Create a new task.</li>
			<li>Configure it to run reports.bat and schedule the task to run at least once per day.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>After the <b>Windows Scheduled Task</b> has been configured, confirm that the scheduled 
		task, batch file, and Report Viewer are working correctly by doing a test run of the task (right 
		click the task in the list and click 'Run').
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><h2>Test Execution</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Open a command prompt and begin the collection of process statistics with the 
		following command string where &quot;Statistics&quot; is the folder created in Step 4 of Machine Preparation.	
		<li><b>LogProcessStats.exe ProcessFiles.exe,SSOCR2.exe,XOCR32b.exe,AdjustImageResolution.exe,CleanupImage.exe,ESConvertToPDF.exe,ESConvertUSSToTxt.exe,ImageFormatConverter.exe,RedactFromXml.exe,RunRules.exe,SQLServerInfo.exe 5m &quot;Statistics&quot;</b>
		<li>Open both the Queueing and the Processing FPS files.
<p>
		<li>Start Processing for the <b>Queue.fps</b> file.
		<li>Start Processing for the <b>Process.fps</b> file.
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><h2>Test Review and Data Analysis</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The following items should be periodically reviewed during processing.
		<ul>
			<li>Processing failures listed on the <b>Processing Log</b> page.
			<li>Memory usage via <b>Task Manager</b>.
			<li>Use xcopy to copy a set of images into a subfolder under <b>Images2</b>.
			This will exercise the file supplier that is listening for new files.
		</ul>
<p>
		<li>The following items should be checked when processing finishes or is stopped.
		<ul>
			<li>Collection of process statistics should be stopped via <b>Ctrl+C</b> in 
			the appropriate command window.
			<li>Open the process statistics spreadsheet <b>ImportData.xls</b>.  
			Import using <b>Ctrl+Shift+I</b> the following CSV files from the Statistics folder.
			<ul>
				<li>cpu.csv
				<li>ProcessFiles.NNN.csv where NNN is the process ID.  
				Import the larger of the two files.
			</ul>
			<li>Save the spreadsheet with a meaningful name.
		</ul>
	</ul>
<p>
	<li><h2>Saving Test Results</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Data will be stored in subfolders under 
		I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\LabDE_10\EnduranceTests.
		<li>The <b>Statistics</b> folder should be copied to a <b>YYYY-MM-DD</b> 
		named subfolder under the associated test subfolder.
		<li>One or more Exception logs can be stored in a <b>UEX_Logs</b> subfolder.
		This is useful if any unexpected errors are noticed during review. 
		<li>SQL Server Management Studio can be used to backup the ENDURANCE 
		database files to a <b>Database</b> subfolder.
		<li>An example path for a particular test is: <br>
<b>I:\Common\Testing\Product Testing\LabDE_10\EnduranceTests\2009-09-02</b>.
		<li>Copy and update a <b>TestDetails.txt</b> file in the YYYY-MM-DD folder.
		This file will contain a summary of the test environment and results.
