	<li><h2>CMPI - General</h2>
     	<ul>
           	<li>Confirm that <b>CreateMultiPageImage</b> requires a suitable license file.
           	<li>Confirm that <b>CreateMultiPageImage /?</b> displays usage text.
          	<li>Confirm that CreateMultiPageImage displays a <b>usage</b> message if other 
		than 2, 3, 5, or 6 arguments are provided on the command-line.
      	</ul>
     	</li>
<p>
	<li><h2>[LegacyRC #5805] Handle large number of files properly</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The batch file <b>test_2000and11000pages.bat</b> that is found in
		the <b>InteractiveTest</b> folder will run the following tests automatically.
		In order to use it, copy the three images and the batch file to a local folder
		and run it.</li>
		<li>Check that the 2000Pages folder contains an image called <b>2000Pages.tif</b>
		and confirm that the image contains 2000 pages.</li>
		<li>Check that the 11000Pages folder contains an image called <b>11000Pages.tif</b>
		and confirm that the image contains 11000 pages.</li>
	</ul>

     	<li><h2>CMPI - File Name Formats - using InteractiveTest folder as command-line argument</h2>
	The batch file <b>test_CreateMultiPageImage.bat</b> that is found in
	the <b>InteractiveTest</b> folder will run the following tests
	automatically.  In order to use it, copy the three images and the
	batch file to a local folder and run it.  The following input file formats are tested.
<p>
      	<ul>
           	<li><b>Name_Dot_DDD_Dot_Tif</b>.  
             	<li><b>Name_Dot_DDD</b>.  
             	<li><b>Name_Hyphen_D_Dot_Tif</b>.  
            	<li><b>Name_Underscore_P_D_Dot_Tif</b>.  
             	<li><b>Name_Underscore_DDDD_Dot_Tif</b>.  
             	<li><b>DDDDDDDD_Dot_Tif</b>.  
     	</ul>
     	</li>
<p>
     	<li><h2>CMPI - File Names From Input File - using InputFiles.txt</h2>
      	<ul>
		<li>Create a collection of single page images and an associated text file 
		to exercise the following command-line arguments.  Note that the text file cannot 
		have a blank line at end-of-file.
           	<li><b>Command-line Arguments</b>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Input file name</b> - the text file that is the source of the 
			following data items
			<ul>
				<li>&quot;D:\Testing\InputFile.txt&quot;, if <b>Input path</b> 
				parameter is not specified
			</ul>
			<li><b>Delimiter</b> - the character used to separate one column of 
			data from another
			<ul>
				<li>&quot;,&quot;
			</ul>
			<li><b>Column number for output image name</b> - which 1-relative column 
			of data from the input file will be used to provide output filenames
			<ul>
				<li>2
			</ul>
			<li><b>Column number for input image name</b> - which 1-relative column 
			of data from the input file will be used to provide input filenames
			<ul>
				<li>1
			</ul>
			<li><b>Output path</b> - the folder that will receive the output images
			<ul>
				<li>&quot;D:\Testing\Output&quot;, if <b>Input path</b> 
				parameter is not specified
			</ul>
			<li><b>Input path</b> - optional argument to specify the folder that 
			contains the input images, allows input image name to use relative paths 
			instead of absolute paths
			<ul>
				<li>&quot;D:\Testing&quot;
			</ul>
		</ul>
       	</ul>
     	</li>
