<ul>
  	<li>Start application and confirm that the application appears in the <b>System Tray</b> 
	with a green icon.
   	<li>Select <b>Configure - Email Settings</b> from the context menu and confirm that the appropriate 
	settings dialog appears.
   	<li>Confirm that the email settings are persistent.
   	<li>Confirm that <b>Exit</b> closes the FDRS application.
<p>
   	<li>Start the <b>File Action Manager</b> first and wait at least one minute.  Start the 
	<b>FDRS</b> application.  Cause an exception or application crash in the <b>File Action 
	Manager</b> and confirm that the system tray icon turns red.
   	<li>Double click on the blinking red icon and confirm display of an exception.
   	<li>Click on the <b>Details</b> button and confirm that an Extract Exception dialog 
	appears.  Close the Exception dialog.
   	<li>Confirm that the dialog disappears on its own in approximately ten seconds.
</ul>
<br>

<!-- *********************************************** -->
<li><h2>Automatic Notification</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Select <b>Configure - Automatic Notifications</b> and confirm that the INI file 
	opens.  Set <b>NumRecipients</b> to 1.  Set <b>Recipient1</b> to the tester's email 
	address.  Set <b>all</b> notifications to 0.
   	<li>Run the <b>File Action Manager</b> and make a change to prompt saving of settings 
	at Exit.  After a confirmation dialog appears, kill the application from <b>Task 
	Manager</b>.  Confirm that an error is displayed (blinking red icon) after one minute with 
	no automatic popup or email.
   	<li>Right click the icon and select <b>Show Exceptions</b>.  Confirm that the 
	dialog appears.
   	<li>Select <b>Close</b> in the dialog.  Confirm that the dialog disappears and 
	that the icon turns <b>yellow</b>.
   	<li>Show the dialog again and select <b>Clear All</b>.  Confirm that the dialog 
	disappears and that the icon turns <b>green</b>.
<p>
   	<li>Turn on the popup notification for logged exceptions.  Create a text file and 
	rename it to a TIF.  Run the <b>File Action Manager</b> and attempt to OCR this 
	TIF file.  Confirm that a popup message appears.
   	<li>Turn off the popup notification for logged exceptions.  Turn on popup notification 
	for application crash.  Repeat the above test killing the <b>File Action Manager</b> 
	from within Task Manager.  Confirm that a popup message appears after 1 minute.
   	<li>Turn off the popup notification for application crash.  Turn on email notification 
	for application crash.  Repeat the above test killing the <b>File Action Manager</b> 
	from within Task Manager.  Confirm a blinking red icon after 1 minute.
<p>
   	<li>Examine the received email message.  Confirm proper sender name.
   	<li>Confirm proper subject line as: <b>[FDRS] Notification of application crash.</b>
   	<li>Confirm proper computer name.
   	<li>Confirm proper application name.
   	<li>Confirm proper process ID.
   	<li>Confirm proper start date.
   	<li>Confirm proper start time.
   	<li>Confirm proper time of crash detection of new line of message.
   	<li>Confirm proper email signature.
<p>
   	<li>Turn off the application crash notifications.  Turn on popup notification for 
	frequent exceptions.  Run the <b>File Action Manager</b>.  Rename a dummy text file 
	as an RSD file.  Run <b>Execute Rules</b> with this fake RSD file against a folder 
	of at least 20 images (per the <b>NumExceptions</b> setting).  Confirm a popup message 
	and a blinking red icon.
   	<li>Turn off the popup notification for frequent exceptions.  Turn on email notification.  
	Run the <b>File Action Manager</b> with the same fake RSD file.  Confirm an email 
	message and a blinking red icon.
<p>
   	<li>Modify the <b>NumExceptions</b> setting so that a single test of the images folder 
	with the fake RSD file described above will not trigger an <b>ExceptionFrequency</b> 
	notification.  Modify the <b>ExceptionCheckDurationInSeconds</b> setting to 60 seconds.  
	Run the <b>File Action Manager</b> with the same fake RSD file.  Confirm the blinking 
	red icon.
   	<li>Confirm the lack of an email message.  Do not clear FDRS exceptions.
   	<li>Wait two minutes and run the <b>File Action Manager</b> again - confirming the lack 
	of an email message.
   	<li>Wait at least two minutes while modifying the automatic notifications to send two 
	email messages by:
	<ol>
		<li>Setting <b>NumExceptions</b> to a number less than the number of images 
		in the folder.</li>
		<li>Settting <b>MinSecondsBetweenEmails</b> to 10 .</li>
	</ol>
 	<li>Run the <b>File Action Manager</b> twice within the 60 second window.  Confirm that 
	two email messages are received.</li>
</ul>
