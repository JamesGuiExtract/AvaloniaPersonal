		<h3>Value Finder Uses</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Value finders are the rule objects that are used to find the desired data.</li>
			<li>They are the "work horses" of the rules.</li>

		<h3>Value Finder Basics</h3>
		<ul>
			<p>
				<li>Each attribute rule must have a single value finder.</li>
				<li>You can add a new attribute rule using the <b>Add</b> button.
					<ul>
						<li>Adding a new attribute rule will bring up a dialog where you choose which type of value finder you want to use. You can also give your attribute rule a description.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>You can use the <b>Delete</b> button to remove the currently selected attribute rule.</li>
				<li>You can modify an existing attribute rule using the <b>Modify...</b> button.</li>
				<li>If you right click on an attribute rule, it will bring up a context menu that you can use to <b>Cut</b>, <b>Copy</b>, <b>Paste</b>, and <b>Delete</b> the rule.</li>
				<li>You can turn off an individual attribute rule by un-checking the checkbox in front of it.  This can be useful for testing.</li>
				<li>If there are multiple attribute rules, they will be executed in order from top to bottom.</li>
				<li>All attribute rules will be executed unless the <b>Stop searching after first value found</b> check box is checked.</li>
				<li>You can change the order of the value modifiers by using the up and down arrow buttons.</li>
