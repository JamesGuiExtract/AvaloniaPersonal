		<h1>Split Attributes Using RSD File Attribute Splitter</h1>
		<hr>
		<h3>Uses</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The Split Attributes Using RSD File attribute splitter can be used to create a custom attribute splitter.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>It does this by inputting the data found by the rules into an external "splitting" .rsd file.</li>
					<li>Any data found by the splitting .rsd file will be added as sub-attribute of the original found data.</li>
					<li>These splitting .rsd files are just a normal .rsd files and as such can use any rules objects.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<h3>Usage</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>To use the Split Attributes Using RSD File attribute splitter you simply need to specify a splitting .rsd file.</li>
			<p>
				<li><b>Example:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Open <b>SplitPhone.rsd</b> and run it on <b>PhoneNumbers.txt</b>.  Note that several phone numbers are found.</li>
						<li>We want to split the phone numbers to create an "AreaCode" sub-attribute and a "Number" sub-attribute for each number.</li>
						<li>To do this, we must first create our splitting .rsd file.
							<ul>
								<li>Open a new .rsd file and add two new attributes, one named <b>AreaCode</b> and one named <b>Number</b>.</li>
								<li>Add a Regular Expression Rule to the <b>AreaCode</b> attribute that contains the regular expression <b>\(\d{3}\)</b>.  This regular expression will "grab" the area code from the phone number.</li>
								<li>Add a Regular Expression Rule to the <b>Number</b> attribute that contains the regular expression <b>\d{3}-\d{4}</b>.  This regular expression will "grab" the number part of the phone number.</li>
								<li>Save the rules as <b>Splitter.rsd</b>.
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Add a Split Attributes Using RSD File attribute splitter to <b>SplitPhone.rsd</b> and configure it to point to <b>Splitter.rsd</b>.</li>
						<li>Run the rules and note that the phone number now has two sub-attributes.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</p>
		</ul>

		<h3>Exercises</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Open <b>StreetAddresses.rsd</b> and run it on <b>Address.txt</b>. Note that the rules find several street addresses.
