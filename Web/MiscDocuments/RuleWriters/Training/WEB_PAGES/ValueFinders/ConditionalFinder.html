<h1>Conditional Value Finder</h1>
<hr>
	<h3>Uses</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The Conditional Value Finder is used to run a specified rule depending on a specified condition.</li>
		<li>Conditional Value Finder allows rule writers to run a rule only if a specified condition is true, or only if a specified condition is false.</li>
		<li>The specified condition can be a Document Type Condition, a Finding Rule Condition, or a RSD File Condition.</li>
		<li>Any rule can be ran through Conditionally Find Value.</li>
	</ul>

<hr>
	<h3>Usage</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>To use the Conditional Value Finder, select it as the find value rule.  Then click the Configure button.</li>
			
		<li>To specify if the rule will run if the condition is true or false, select <i>true</i> or <i>false</i> from the true/false drop menu.</li>
		<li>To specify the type of condition select it from the drop down menu.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>Document type condition allows rule writers to specify the type(s) of documents that must be matched for the specified rule to run.</li>
				<ul><li>Select whether the type of documents selected should be matched or not matched from the drop-down menu.</li>
				<li>Click the Select button to select the type(s) of documents from the list of document types.</li>
				<li>Next set the level of probablity of the classification to <i>maybe</i>, <i>probable</i> or <i>sure</i>.  This sets the classification level the document must at least have for the condition to pass.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>RSD file condition allows the output of a seperate RSD file as the condition that is met or not met to run the specified rule.  The Conditionally find value rule will call a specified RSD file configured by specifying the path name of the RSD file's etf file.  The condition is met if the specified rule set finds at least one attribute.</li>
				<ul><li>A seperate RSD file must exsit for this rule, and is usually created specifically for this purpose.  Any appropriate rules should be created in the RSD file set to act as the condition.</li>
				<li>Note: Always call the etf file of the RSD file you wish to call.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
