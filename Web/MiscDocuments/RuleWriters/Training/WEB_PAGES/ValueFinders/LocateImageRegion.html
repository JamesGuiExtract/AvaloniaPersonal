		<hr>
		<h3>Uses</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The Locate Image Region value finder is used to redact or extract text from a specified region of a document.</li>
			<li>It uses the position of specified clues in the document to find the desired region.</li>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<h3>Usage</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>To use the Locate Image Region value finder, you must first specify whether you want to find an image region or text.
				<ul>
					<li>Image regions contain only the spatial information of the found region.
						<ul>
							<li>They are primarily used to redact the region in the ID Shield product.</li>
							<li>When you create an image region, you will have to assign some "placeholder" text for the found spatial information in the <b>Assign the following text to the image region</b> box.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>If you choose to find text, the Locate Image Region value finder will extract and return all of the text contained in the found region.
						<ul>
							<li>This option is primarily used to extract data from a certain region of the document for the FLEX Index product.</li>
							<li>You can choose to whether to include or exclude characters or words that intersect the boundaries of the region.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>You can choose whether to return only the first region that is found or to return all of the regions that are found.</li>
			<li>Next, you will need to specify the clues that will be used to find the region as well as where the region is located in relation to the specified clues.
				<ul>
					<li>Clues can be added, deleted, and modified using the <b>Add...</b>, <b>Remove</b>, and <b>Modify...</b> buttons.
						<ul>
							<li>The clues can be plain text or regular expressions.</li>
							<li>The clues can be made case sensitive.</li>
							<li>You can have up to four separate clue lists that you can use to find the image region.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>You can specify were the region is relative to the clues by using <b>Region Boundaries</b> box.
						<ul>
							<li>You will need to define the location of the top, bottom, left, and right boundaries of the region.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>You can also expand the boundaries of the region to be a specified distance away from the specified clues.</li>
                    <li>You can expand the top and bottom boundaries up or down by a specified number of lines.
                        <ul>
                            <li>A "line" is defined as the average height of the text in the document.</li>
                            <li>You can specify fractional numbers of lines.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>You can expand the left and right boundaries left or right by a specified number of characters.</li>
