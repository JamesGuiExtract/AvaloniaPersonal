<h1>Spot Recognition Window</h1>

<hr>
<ul>
  <li><b>The Spot Recognition Window</b> is used to view images and associated <i>attributes</i>, and to create these attributes.</li>
  <li><b>The Toolbar</b>
  <ul><li>The first three buttons, left to right, on the toolbar are for opening and printing images and saving highlights.</li>
    <li>The next group contains buttons for zooming in and out and moving the viewport around. If you hold your mouse over one of these buttons for a moment, a tooltip will appear and display a brief description of the tool and its keyboard shortcut.</li>
    <li>The next group is for making highlights/attributes.
    <ul>
    <li>The first button in this group is the highlighting tool. This tool has two modes, one to make perfectly horizontal, rectangular zones and one to make skewed zones, and will look like either a yellow rectangle or a yellow marker, depending on which variety is selected. If the horizontal zone tool is selected, you will be able to drag a rectangle on the current image. If the any-angle zone tool is selected, you will be able to draw a line that has a rectangle extending out from it. The height of this rectangle can be changed while drawing by using the + and - keys or preset with the next tool.</li>
    <li>The default height tool looks like an 'A' with a ruler next to it. To use this tool, click and drag to the desired height and the any angle zone tool will be selected and ready to create a highlight of that height.</li>
    <li>The next tool allows you to alter the text associated with a highlight but is not useful for creating attributes.</li>
  </ul></li>
    <li>The last tool in this group allows you to erase highlights by clicking on them.</li>
    <li>The next tool looks like a printed page and allows you to select an area and recognize the text within it. The recognized text is either displayed or sent to the application that opened the Spot Recognition Window.</li>
    <li>The last few buttons allow you to rotate the image and to change pages.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
