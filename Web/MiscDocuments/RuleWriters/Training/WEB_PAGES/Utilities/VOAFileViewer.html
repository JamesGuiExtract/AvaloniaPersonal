			<li>The VOA File Viewer allows you to view and edit .voa files.</li>
			<li><b>To create a new attribute:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Click the <i>New Attribute</i> button (or press &lt;ENTER&gt;).</li>
					<li>Click on the icon that looks like a pink piece of paper to open a Spot Recognition Window.</li>
					<li>From the Spot Recognition Window, open an image file.</li>
					<li>Use the <b>Any-Angle Zone</b> or <b>Horizontal Zone</b> tool to create a highlight on the image.</li>
					<li>If text was recognized in the area under the highlight, it will become the attribute's <i>Value</i>, otherwise you will be prompted to enter text.</li>
					<li>It is a good idea to enter a type for the attribute to simplify testing.</li>
					<li>Note: When closing the Spot Recognition Window, you will be prompted to <i>save changes you made to this document?</i> This is referring to the highlights, which can be saved but aren't useful for our purposes, and you should click <i>No</i>.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>To edit an existing attribute:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Double-click on an attribute to open a Spot Recognition Window and display it.</li>
					<li>With a highlighter tool, create a new highlight. This will be the attribute's new value.</li>
					<li>Notice that, when you create a new value for an attribute, its type will clear and should be re-entered.</li>
					<li><b>Tip:</b><br>
					If you are adding an attribute to an existing .voa file, it is easier to double click on an existing attribute to open the Spot Recognition Window and then add the new attribute in the VOA File Viewer&mdash;that way you don't have to open the image.</li>
					<li><b>Watch out!</b><br>
					When using the above tip, make sure that you create the new attribute before creating a highlight or you will change the value of whatever attribute you have selected.</li>
				</ul>
