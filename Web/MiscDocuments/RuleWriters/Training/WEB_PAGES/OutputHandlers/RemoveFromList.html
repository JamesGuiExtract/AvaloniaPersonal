<h1>Remove Entries From List Output Handler</h1>
<hr>
	<h3>Uses</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The <b>Remove Entries From List</b> Output Handler is used to remove all instances of one or more specific results from the Output.</li>
		<li>Example:  <i>000-32-4324</i> is not a valid Social Security Number.  If your rules are finding this, you could use <b>Remove Entries From List</b> to keep that from showing up in your output, and thus reducing your false positives.</li>
		<li>In some cases, you could have a rule that's meant to find and eliminate false positives.  You could set a Value Modifier to change the value to a catch-all, such as <i>false</i>, and use the <b>Remove Entries From List</b> Output Handler to remove them.  This is only useful in specific cases.</li>
	</ul>

<hr>
	<h3>Usage</h3>
	<ul>

		<li>There are also the Modify and Delete buttons, which allow you to edit or remove entries from the list.</li>
		<li>A checkbox below allows you to make the list entries case sensitive.</li>
	</ul>
