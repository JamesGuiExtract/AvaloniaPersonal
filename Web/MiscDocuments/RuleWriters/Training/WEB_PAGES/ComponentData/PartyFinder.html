        <h3>Party Finder</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Party Finder captures, trims, and splits parties on land record documents.</li>
            <li>The party finder rules can be called from<b> &ltComponentDataDir&gt\Indexing\PartyFinder\Master.rsd.etf </b></li>
            <li>The best practice for using the party finder is to use a Document Type Condition to select the document type you want to work with, and then call the attribute of the party you want to find.
                <ul>
                    <li>For example, if you wanted to find mortgagors on mortgage documents, you would create a Conditionally Find Value value finder, give it a Document Type Condition that will pass if the document type is <b>Mortgage</b>, and then call the <b>Mortgagor</b> attribute from <b> &ltComponentDataDir&gt\Indexing\PartyFinder\Master.rsd.etf </b>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
