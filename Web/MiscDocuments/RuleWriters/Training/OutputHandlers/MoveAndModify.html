		<h1>Move And Modify Attributes Output Handler</h1>
		<hr>
		<h3>Uses</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The Move and Modify Attributes output handler is used to promote sub-attributes and change their name and type.</li>
			<li>The promoted sub-attributes are moved and not copied.</li>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<h3>Usage</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>To use the Move And Modify Attributes output handler, you must first query the attributes that you wish to modify.
				<ul>
					<li>To do this enter your query into the builtin <a href="../Selectors/QueryAttribute.html">Query Attribute Selector</a>.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Next, you must choose what you wish to do with the queried attribute:
				<ul>
					<li>You can promote the attribute up one level.</li>
					<li>You can promote the attribute to the top level.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Next, you will have to decide what to name the promoted sub-attribute:
				<ul>
					<li>You can leave its name unchanged.</li>
					<li>You can change its name to that of its parent.</li>
					<li>You can specify an entirely new name.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Next, you will have to decide what the type of the promoted sub-attribute will be
				<ul>
					<li>You can leave its type unchanged.</li>
					<li>You can leave its type blank.</li>
					<li>You can add its type to that of its parent.</li>
					<li>You can add the attribute's name to its type.</li>
					<li>You can specify an entirely new name to add.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>If you check the <b>If, after the above operations, the root ancestor has no children, delete it</b> checkbox, the parent attribute will be deleted if all of its sub-attributes are promoted.</li>
					
		</ul>

		<h3>Exercises</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Open <b>SplitPhone.rsd</b> and run it on <b>SplitPhone.txt</b>.  Notice that the <i>PhoneNumber</i> attribute has been split to create an <i>AreaCode</i> sub-attribute and a <i>Number</i> sub-attribute.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Add a Move and Modify Attributes output handler that promotes the <i>AreaCode</i> sub-attribute to the top level to the existing Select Multiple Output Handlers output handler.  Leave the default configurations.</li>
					<li>Run the rules and note the difference in output.</li>
					<li>Open the Move and Modify Attributes output handler and select <b>Use the root ancestor's name</b> option.  Run the rules again and note that the promoted sub-attribute is now named <i>PhoneNumber</i>.</li>
					<li>Open the Move and Modify Attributes output handler and check <b>Add the root ancestor's type</b> option.  Run the rules again and note that the promoted sub-attribute now has a type of <i>PhoneNum</i>.</li>
					<li>Open the Move and Modify Attributes output handler and change the query to <i>PhoneNumber/AreaCode|PhoneNumber/Number</i>.  Run the rules again and notice that the parent attribute is deleted.</li>
					<li>Open the Move and Modify Attributes output handler and uncheck the <b>If, after the above operations, the root ancestor has no children, delete it</b> checkbox.  Run the rules again and notice that the parent attribute is not deleted.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
