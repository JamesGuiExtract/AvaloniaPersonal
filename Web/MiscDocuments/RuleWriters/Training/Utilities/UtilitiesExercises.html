							<li>Process the queued files using an <b>OCR document</b> task.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</li>

					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Try highlighting some text and note how the <b>Start Pos</b> and <b>End Pos</b> values change.</li>
							<li>Search for the text <i>THE</i> and note that every time the <b>Find</b> button is pressed the next instance of <i>THE</i> is highlighted in the USS File Viewer.</li>
							<li>Make the above search case sensitive.  Notice how the results change.</li>
							<li>Use a regular expression to search for a social security number with the form ###-##-####.</li>
