		<h1>Advanced Replace String Document Preprocessor</h1>
		<hr>
		<h3>Uses</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Advanced Replace String preprocessor is used to change or remove text from a document before a value finder is run on that text.</li>
				<li>It is most often used to prevent erroneous redactions.</li>
				<li>For example, if you were trying to redact social security numbers you would probably write a Regular Expression Rule that would catch all numbers with a format of <b>\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}</b>.   However, in Louisiana, state project numbers also have this format. (The top of the document often says something like, "State Project No. 033-03-0034".)  You regular expression rule will also catch the state project number, even though it is not a social security number.  This can be avoided by using an Advanced Replace String preprocessors to remove the all strings with a format of <b>STATE\sPROJECT\sNO\.\s\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}</b>.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>Usage</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>To use the Advanced Replace String preprocessor you must specify the text you want to find and the text you want to replace the found text with.
					<ul>
						<li>These two items can be either plain text or a regular expression.</li>
						<li>They can also be made case sensitive.</li>
						<li>You can remove a certain piece of text by leaving the <b>Replace with:</b> box blank.</li>
						<li>You can also read these items from .txt files.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>You can also choose which occurrences of the specified text you want to replace:
					<ul>
						<li>All occurrences</li>
						<li>The first occurrence</li>
						<li>The last occurrence</li>
						<li>A certain occurrence</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<p>
					<li><b>Example:</b>
						<ul>
							<li>Open <b>ARS_StateProjectNumber.rsd</b>.  This file finds numbers with a ###-##-#### format.</li>
							<li>Run this rules file on <b>StateProjectNumber.txt</b>. Note that the state project number is erroneously found.</li>
							<li>Add an Advanced Replace String preprocessor that removes <b>STATE\sPROJECT\sNO\.\s\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}</b>.</li>
							<li>Run the rules again.  Note that now only the valid social security number is found.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
