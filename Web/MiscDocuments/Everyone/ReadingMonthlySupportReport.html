<H1>How to read the monthly Support Report</H1></p>

<p>The Technical Support Manager will publish a monthly Support Report on the first
Wednesday after the first Monday of the month. It will be accessible through the Engineering Web and by a link in the
Sales Tracker. Any questions about the report should be directed to the Technical Support
Manager.</p>

<p>The report is designed to give basic information about the activities of the UCLID
Support team. It should be able to provide you with general answers to the following questions:
<ul>
<li>Who used Technical Support services?
<li>How many times did a customer contact us?
<li>Why did they contact us? Or, What type of issues did they need resolved?
<li>What was the actual cause of the issue?
<li>Did a Support Contract cover the customer? If not, what charges were paid?
<li>Who needs to be contacted about support contract expiration?</ul>
</p>

<p>In the Support Report you will find three tables.
<ol>
<li>The first table identifies contacts by company. It lists from left to right:
<br><ul><li>The number of calls received from the customer
<li>The name of the company
<li>The Registration Key #
<li>The types of concerns expressed
<li>The cause of technical issues
<li>The time spent on the phone or writing emails
<li>The time spent researching a solution
<li>Status of the support contract
<li>Any charges that were applied.</ul>
<br>
<li>The second table identifies the types of calls received by the technical support team. It lists from left to right:
<br><ul><li>The number of calls received
<li>A common call type 
<li>A cause shared by all calls in that group
<li>A summary of how issues were resolved
<li>The time spent on the phone or writing emails
<li>The time spent researching a solution</ul>
<br>
<li>The third table identifies companies that need to be informed about the upcoming expiration of their support contract. It lists from left to right:
<br><ul><li>The end date of the contract
<li>The name of the company
<li>The Registration Key #
<li>General comments about the customer
<li>The total number of issues logged during the course of the contract.</ul>
This table does not appear in reports from 2000.
</ol>
</p>

<p>You will also find a brief paragraph offering some speculation on trends or
specific concerns and describing the month’s events from the perspective of the
support team.</p>
