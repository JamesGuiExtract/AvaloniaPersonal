Test setup:
Copy the "FTPMemoryLeak" dirctory in the "SourceImages" folder into the root folder for the ExtractTest account.

Note that this test assumes that 6 FTP operations can be performed on 70 files within a 30 second period. It uses 70 simultaneous tasks which is not necessarily a realistic scenario.
