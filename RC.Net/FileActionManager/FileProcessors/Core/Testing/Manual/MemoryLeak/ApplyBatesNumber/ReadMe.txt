In order to run the specified memory leak tests, the MEMORY_LEAK database must contain the following:
1. An action named 'test'
2. A counter named 'Bates Number'

The starting value for the counter does not matter (if you add a new counter the default
value will be 0 - the first number added when the counter is 0 is 1)

If you clear the database from the DB Admin you will need to re-add the counter.
